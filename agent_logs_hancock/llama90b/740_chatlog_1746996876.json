Hemostasis was eventually achieved using bipolar coagulation, ligation of a small vascular stump, and irrigation with Ringer's solution and H2O2. Intraoperatively, the patient received 7 ampoules of Minirin, 1 platelet concentrate, and 1000 mg of tranexamic acid. The surgery concluded with a Redon drain insertion and closure of the surgical site. The patient was transferred intubated and ventilated to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further monitoring and management, with instructions for continued administration of tranexamic acid, Minirin, and follow-up lab checks to assess platelet function and coagulation status.\nNew files available:\n[FILE: PrimaryTumor_HE_740.jpg]\n[FILE: PrimaryTumor_HE_740_roi.jpg]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD3_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD3_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD8_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD8_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD56_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD56_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD68_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD68_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD163_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD163_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_HE_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_HE_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_MHC1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_MHC1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_PDL1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_PDL1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD3_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD3_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD8_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD8_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD56_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD56_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD68_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD68_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD163_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD163_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_HE_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_HE_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_MHC1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_MHC1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_PDL1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_PDL1_1.png]\n[FILE: surgery_report.txt]\n[FILE: surgery_descriptions.txt]\n[FILE: ops_codes.json]\n[FILE: patient_pathological_data.json]\n[FILE: patient_clinical_data.json]\n[FILE: history_text.txt]\n[FILE: icd_codes.json]\n[FILE: patient_blood_data.json]\n[FILE: blood_data_reference_ranges.json]Remember that you can ask for files by providing the following tag [REQUEST: filename.extension].

Subsequent reopening of the cutaneous and subcutaneous suture. Aspiration of the hematoma. Overall, there is diffuse bleeding in several places and a minimal vascular stump cranial to the paralaryngeal omohyoid muscle. This is ligated, but then breaks off; it can no longer be found during the dissection, but this site is extensively coagulated and no further bleeding occurs centrally. Other sites are also extensively bipolar coagulated. Overall, no large or medium-sized vessel can be identified that could have caused the bleeding. Repeated irrigation with Ringer's and finally also with H2O2, again no relevant bleeding, not even after raising the systolic blood pressure above 120 mmHg. Therefore, another Redon insertion, subcutaneous and skin sutures with 4.0 Vicryl and 4.0 Ethilon. Enorally dry conditions, therefore termination of the operation. Note: At the beginning of the operation, the patient again received 7 ampoules of Minirin and 1 platelet concentrate intraoperatively. He also received 1000 mg tranexamic acid. Tranexamic acid 1000 mg please 3 times daily, BGA check in intensive care unit. Minirin 7 ampoules every 12 hours. Before the next administration, please check the PFA and platelet aggregation in the laboratory and consult the transfusion medicine colleagues again tomorrow. The patient goes to the intensive care unit intubated and ventilated.\"\n[FILE: history_text.txt] included\n\"Today the patient underwent a neck dissection and an enoral tumor resection for cT1 to 2 oropharyngeal carcinoma on the left.
