A mass in this region was excised using a helium laser, maintaining a 1 cm margin around the lesion.

On retraction, the entire length of the oesophagus is seen with a whitish coating and some reddish areas, but without evidence of deeper erosion or bleeding. Now panendoscopy. Inspection of the oral cavity reveals an ulcer approx. 1 1/2 cm long on the posterior palatal arch, which can be palpated as slightly hardened, and the upper tonsil pole on the left side is palpable. The palatal arch or glossotonsillar groove, tonsillar lobe and tongue are free on the right side. The base of the tongue is also palpable. The vallecula and epiglottis are also inconspicuous, as are the posterior and lateral pharyngeal walls. The piriform sinus can be opened very well on both sides. The postcricoid region also opens well and is free. In Cormack I, the vocal folds are easily adjustable up to the anterior commissure and are also inconspicuous. The Mc Ivor blade is now inserted and the mass removed by excisional biopsy with the helium laser. Care is taken to ensure that there is an approx. 1 cm margin around the mass. The left half of the uvula is missing. The tonsil itself is very small and remains intact. The specimen is marked with sutures and a resection is made in the lateral part if the mucosa hardens. The frozen section shows an invasive squamous cell carcinoma resected in sano. A piece of hardened mucosa that does not appear suspicious is resected as a lateral resection and sent for final histology. After a second look, there is no evidence of bleeding in the tonsil lobe. After a final consultation with the anesthesiologist, the operation is terminated.

However, the patient has undergone a successful surgical procedure to remove the tumor, and the margins are clear.\n\nAdditionally, I can see that the patient's blood test results are mostly within normal ranges, with a few exceptions. The patient's creatinine level is slightly below the normal range, which may indicate some kidney dysfunction. However, the patient's glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is within the normal range, which suggests that the kidney function is not severely impaired.\n\nThe patient's lymphocyte count is slightly above the normal range, which may indicate some immune system activation. However, this is not necessarily a cause for concern, as the patient's overall immune system function appears to be normal.\n\nOverall, based on the provided information, I believe that the patient's cancer is unlikely to recur in 2 years, given the successful surgical procedure and the absence of any obvious signs of metastasis or other complications.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is:\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"
