The fact that keratinization is evident points toward a **conventional keratinizing SCC**, rather than a non-keratinizing variant.\n\n### Differential Diagnosis:\n- **Adenocarcinoma**: Typically lacks keratin pearls and shows glandular differentiation.\n- **Small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma**: Characterized by small, round cells with scant cytoplasm, which is not observed here.\n- **Clear cell carcinoma**: Cells would have clear cytoplasm, which is not present.\n- **Synovial sarcoma**: Typically shows a spindle cell pattern and lacks keratinization.\n\n### Final Answer:\nBased on the histopathological features visible on the H&E images, the most likely histologic type of the tumor is:\n\n[ANSWER: A) SCC_Conventional-Keratinizing]  "

However, the provided images do not clearly show such features.\n- **Further Confirmation**: Immunohistochemical (IHC) stains for neural markers (e.g., S-100 protein) could help confirm the presence of nerves and perineural invasion, but these are not directly relevant to the H&E analysis.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the provided H&E images, there is no clear evidence of perineural invasion in the tumor.\n\n[ANSWER: B) No, perineural invasion is absent]  "

However, the question asks us to consider which immune marker might correlate with perineural invasion if it were present.\n\n### Correlation Between Immune Markers and Perineural Invasion:\n- **Perineural invasion** is often associated with aggressive tumor behavior and can involve interactions between tumor cells and the immune system. While the current data does not show perineural invasion, we can infer which immune markers might be relevant based on general knowledge and typical associations:\n  - **Macrophages (CD68)**: Macrophages are known to play a role in promoting tumor progression and invasion, including perineural invasion. They can secrete factors that degrade the extracellular matrix and facilitate tumor spread.\n  - **T-cells (CD3/CD8)**: While T-cells are important for anti-tumor immunity, their low infiltration in this case suggests they are not actively contributing to perineural invasion.\n  - **NK Cells (CD56)**: NK cells are involved in innate immunity but are not typically strongly associated with perineural invasion.\n  - **PDL1 and MHC1**: These markers are related to immune checkpoint pathways and antigen presentation, respectively, but their roles in perineural invasion are indirect and not as strongly correlated as macrophages.\n\n### Most Likely Correlation:\nGiven the available data and the general understanding of immune markers associated with perineural invasion, **high CD68+ macrophage infiltration** is the most plausible marker to correlate with perineural invasion, should it be present.\n\n### Final Answer:\n[ANSWER: A) High CD68+ macrophage infiltration at the invasion front]  "

Therefore, robust T-cell infiltration is not supported by the data.\n   - **Conclusion**: This option is **not likely**.\n\n#### **Option B: High levels of CD56+ NK cell infiltration in the tumor center prevented metastasis**\n   - **Analysis**: The IHC data shows **low infiltration** of CD56+ NK cells in both the tumor center and invasion front. Therefore, high NK cell infiltration is not supported by the data.\n   - **Conclusion**: This option is **not likely**.\n\n#### **Option C: Low PDL1 expression in the tumor center indicates poor immune evasion by the tumor**\n   - **Analysis**: While PDL1 expression can influence immune evasion, no specific data on PDL1 expression was provided in the analyses. Without knowing the PDL1 status, we cannot definitively link low PDL1 expression to the absence of metastasis.\n   - **Conclusion**: This option is **uncertain** due to missing data.\n\n#### **Option D: High macrophage infiltration suppressed tumor growth and metastasis**\n   - **Analysis**: The IHC data shows **higher CD68+ macrophage infiltration in the tumor center** compared to the invasion front. Macrophages can play dual roles\u2014some subtypes promote tumor growth and metastasis, while others (e.g., M1 macrophages) can suppress tumor progression. However, the data does not specify the subtype of macrophages present.\n   - **Conclusion**: While macrophage infiltration is noted, the role of macrophages in suppressing metastasis is speculative without additional context.\n\n#### **Option E: Low MHC1 expression suggests impaired antigen presentation and minimal lymph node involvement**\n   - **Analysis**: MHC1 is crucial for antigen presentation to T-cells. Low MHC1 expression could impair the ability of the immune system to recognize and respond to the tumor, potentially leading to reduced lymph node involvement. However, no specific data on MHC1 expression was provided.\n   - **Conclusion**: This option is **uncertain** due to missing data.\n\n#### **Option F: The tumor's keratinizing SCC histology is generally associated with low metastasis potential**\n   - **Analysis**: Keratinizing SCCs are typically considered aggressive tumors with a higher risk of metastasis. Therefore, this option contradicts the general understanding of SCC biology.\n   - **Conclusion**: This option is **not likely**.\n\n### Most Likely Explanation:\nGiven the available data, the most plausible explanation is **Option D**: High macrophage infiltration suppressed tumor growth and metastasis. Although the role of macrophages is complex, the observed higher infiltration in the tumor center suggests a potential suppressive effect on metastasis.\n\n### Final Answer:\n[ANSWER: D) High macrophage infiltration suppressed tumor growth and metastasis]  "

The tumor was larger than initially estimated, with necrotic cavities and extensive scarring and fixation of the tongue. The procedure involved challenging airway management due to limited oral access, poor neck hyperextensibility, and prior radiation therapy, necessitating a protective tracheostomy to secure the airway post-resection.

Histological samples were taken from the resected tissue, and a safety margin of 5 mm was maintained during resection. Postoperatively, the patient\u2019s swallowing function requires monitoring, and further treatment options, including defect coverage with a radial flap, remain under consideration.
