You may also ask for multiple files at once if necessary. If you ask for a file, you MUST WAIT to receive it from the user.\nYou must provide a separate [REQUEST] tag for each file you need. Example [REQUEST: image1.jpg] [REQUEST: image2.jpg].\nYou can also use the CONCH model to determine cancer type or invasion by providing the H&E image name and extension and a list of options. Example: [CONCH: image1.jpg, (melanoma), (squamous cell carcinoma)] [CONCH: image2.jpg, (option 1), (option 2)].\nThe model will then tell you which option resembles the image the most. You can ONLY use this model for H&E.\n"

During the surgery, a 2 cm submucosal nodular lesion was identified in the left oropharyngeal side wall. This lesion was excised with a 0.5 cm safety margin and sent for frozen section analysis. The pathologist reported no evidence of invasive carcinoma or carcinoma in situ, though moderate dysplasia was noted in the lateral area of the specimen. No further resection was performed at this site.  \n\nThe procedure continued with bilateral neck dissections. On the right side, levels II-V were dissected, sparing major structures except for the external jugular vein, and slightly enlarged lymph nodes were removed from level V. On the left side, a large metastatic lymph node was identified at level II (near the border of level Ib) and was resected en bloc. The dissection extended to levels II-V on the left while sparing key nerves and vascular structures, except for the external jugular vein. Redon drains were inserted, and the wound was closed in layers. No gastric tube was required as the defect was localized, and the patient can cautiously begin a liquid or mushy diet. Histological analysis of the resected tissues is pending, and the patient will be discussed in the tumor board to determine the need for adjuvant therapy.\nNew files available:\n [FILE: PrimaryTumor_HE_403.jpg]\n[FILE: PrimaryTumor_HE_403_roi.jpg]\n[FILE: LymphNode_HE_403.jpg]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD3_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD3_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD8_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD8_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD56_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD56_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD68_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD68_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD163_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD163_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_HE_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_HE_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_MHC1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_MHC1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_PDL1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_PDL1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD3_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD3_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD8_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD8_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD56_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD56_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD68_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD68_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD163_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD163_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_HE_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_HE_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_MHC1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_MHC1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_PDL1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_PDL1_1.png]\n[FILE: surgery_report.txt]\n[FILE: surgery_descriptions.txt]\n[FILE: ops_codes.json]\n[FILE: patient_pathological_data.json]\n[FILE: patient_clinical_data.json]\n[FILE: history_text.txt]\n[FILE: icd_codes.json]\n[FILE: patient_blood_data.json]\n[FILE: blood_data_reference_ranges.json]Remember that you can ask for files by providing the following tag [REQUEST: filename.extension].
