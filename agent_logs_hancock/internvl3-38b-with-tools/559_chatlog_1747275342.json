The surgery involved several key components, including:  \n\n1. **Initial Septal and Sinus Surgery**: Correction of a deviated nasal septum with removal of a cartilaginous bony spur, and surgery for fungal sinusitis affecting the right maxillary sinus. This included clearing of the maxillary sinus, removal of the uncinate process, and creation of a maxillary sinus window.  \n\n2. **Transoral-Transcervical Tumor Resection**: The entire right tonsil, along with tumor tissue extending to the glossotonsillar groove and base of the tongue, was resected. Margins were confirmed as tumor-free on frozen section analysis.  \n\n3. **Bilateral Neck Dissections**: Regions I-V on the right side and II-V on the left side were dissected to remove lymphatic tissue and a cystic metastasis while sparing critical structures like the lingual and hypoglossal nerves.  \n\n4. **Defect Reconstruction**: A microvascular radial forearm free flap was harvested from the left forearm and used to reconstruct the defect (9 x 5 cm) created by the tumor resection. Arterial and venous anastomoses were completed with the facial artery and internal jugular vein, respectively.  \n\n5. **Additional Procedures**: A tracheostomy was created to secure the airway, and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube was inserted for nutritional support. The left forearm donor site was covered with a split-thickness skin graft from the right thigh.  \n\nThe surgery was concluded without complications, with stable wound closure and hemostasis achieved. Frozen section analysis confirmed clear margins, indicating successful tumor removal. The patient now has a reconstructed oropharyngeal defect and a tracheostomy in place to ensure airway patency.\nNew files available:\n [FILE: PrimaryTumor_HE_559.jpg]\n[FILE: PrimaryTumor_HE_559_roi.jpg]\n[FILE: LymphNode_HE_559.jpg]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD3_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD3_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD8_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD8_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD56_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD56_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD68_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD68_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD163_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD163_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_HE_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_HE_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_MHC1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_MHC1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_PDL1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_PDL1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD3_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD3_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD8_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD8_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD56_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD56_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD68_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD68_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD163_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD163_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_HE_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_HE_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_MHC1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_MHC1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_PDL1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_PDL1_1.png]\n[FILE: surgery_report.txt]\n[FILE: surgery_descriptions.txt]\n[FILE: ops_codes.json]\n[FILE: patient_pathological_data.json]\n[FILE: patient_clinical_data.json]\n[FILE: history_text.txt]\n[FILE: icd_codes.json]\n[FILE: patient_blood_data.json]\n[FILE: blood_data_reference_ranges.json]Remember that you can ask for files by providing the following tag [REQUEST: filename.extension].
