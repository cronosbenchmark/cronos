The procedure included the creation of a tracheostomy, bilateral neck dissection (with significant scarring from prior surgeries), tumor resection with free margins, and reconstruction of the defect using a radial forearm free flap. The surgery was complicated by challenging anatomical and vascular conditions, including heavy scarring and the absence of the internal jugular vein on the right side. Marginal samples revealed carcinoma in situ and moderate dysplasia in some areas, leaving the possibility of residual microscopic disease. Postoperative care includes flap monitoring, antibiotics, nutritional support via PEG tube, and eventual swallow and speech rehabilitation.
