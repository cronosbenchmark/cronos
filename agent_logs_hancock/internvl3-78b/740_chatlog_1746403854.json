However, it was completely resected (R0), and there is no evidence of lymphovascular or perineural invasion, which are positive prognostic factors.\n- **Postoperative Complications**: The significant postoperative bleeding and need for ICU care indicate a higher risk of complications, but the patient's coagulation status is otherwise normal.\n- **Overall Health**: The patient's renal function, electrolyte levels, and other blood test results are within normal ranges, suggesting good overall health aside from the cancer diagnosis.\n\nConsidering these factors, the patient's 5-year survival is uncertain but not impossible. High-grade oropharyngeal SCC can be aggressive, but complete resection and absence of metastasis are favorable indicators.

Subsequent reopening of the cutaneous and subcutaneous suture. Aspiration of the hematoma. Overall, there is diffuse bleeding in several places and a minimal vascular stump cranial to the paralaryngeal omohyoid muscle. This is ligated, but then breaks off; it can no longer be found during the dissection, but this site is extensively coagulated and no further bleeding occurs centrally. Other sites are also extensively bipolar coagulated. Overall, no large or medium-sized vessel can be identified that could have caused the bleeding. Repeated irrigation with Ringer's and finally also with H2O2, again no relevant bleeding, not even after raising the systolic blood pressure above 120 mmHg. Therefore, another Redon insertion, subcutaneous and skin sutures with 4.0 Vicryl and 4.0 Ethilon. Enorally dry conditions, therefore termination of the operation. Note: At the beginning of the operation, the patient again received 7 ampoules of Minirin and 1 platelet concentrate intraoperatively. He also received 1000 mg tranexamic acid. Tranexamic acid 1000 mg please 3 times daily, BGA check in intensive care unit. Minirin 7 ampoules every 12 hours. Before the next administration, please check the PFA and platelet aggregation in the laboratory and consult the transfusion medicine colleagues again tomorrow.

However, it was completely resected (R0), and there is no evidence of lymphovascular or perineural invasion, which are positive prognostic factors.\n- **Postoperative Complications**: The significant postoperative bleeding and need for ICU care indicate a higher risk of complications, but the patient's coagulation status is otherwise normal.\n- **Overall Health**: The patient's renal function, electrolyte levels, and other blood test results are within normal ranges, suggesting good overall health aside from the cancer diagnosis.\n\nConsidering these factors, the patient's risk of cancer recurrence within 2 years is uncertain but not impossible. High-grade oropharyngeal SCC can be aggressive, but complete resection and absence of metastasis are favorable indicators. The postoperative complications add some risk, but the patient's overall health appears stable.\n\n**A) Yes**\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"
