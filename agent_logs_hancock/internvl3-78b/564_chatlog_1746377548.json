The tumor involved the palatal arch, the upper tonsillar lobe, parts of the oropharyngeal side wall, and extended towards the base of the tongue. A transoral resection was performed with a safety margin of 1-1.5 cm, achieving clear margins (R0 resection). Following tumor removal, bilateral neck dissection was conducted, with levels II-V cleared on the right side and levels II-IV on the left. Several malignant or suspicious lymph nodes were identified cranially in levels II-III. A tracheostomy was created for airway management, and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube was inserted to facilitate postoperative feeding.  \n\nTo reconstruct the surgical defect, a radial forearm free flap was harvested from the left arm. The flap was vascularized through arterial and venous anastomoses, which demonstrated good blood flow and venous return during the procedure. The flap was sutured into place to close the defect without tension. The donor site on the forearm was covered with a split-thickness skin graft harvested from the thigh. Post-surgery, the flap had good intraoral blood supply, and Doppler checks confirmed adequate blood flow. The procedure concluded without complications, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for monitoring.  \n\nIntraoperative antibiotic therapy with Unacid was initiated and is recommended to continue for one week. Anticoagulation with heparin (500 units/hour) was started and should be continued for five days. Feeding through the PEG tube should proceed for 7-10 days, with gradual reintroduction of oral intake based on clinical findings and swallowing ability. Postoperative monitoring includes clinical and Doppler checks for the vitality of the flap over the next five days. Final histopathology results are pending and will guide further treatment planning at the interdisciplinary tumor conference.\nNew files available:\n[FILE: PrimaryTumor_HE_564.jpg]\n[FILE: PrimaryTumor_HE_564_roi.jpg]\n[FILE: LymphNode_HE_564.jpg]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD3_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD3_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD8_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD8_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD56_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD56_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD68_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD68_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD163_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD163_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_HE_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_HE_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_MHC1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_MHC1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_PDL1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_PDL1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD3_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD3_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD8_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD8_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD56_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD56_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD68_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD68_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD163_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD163_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_HE_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_HE_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_MHC1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_MHC1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_PDL1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_PDL1_1.png]\n[FILE: surgery_report.txt]\n[FILE: surgery_descriptions.txt]\n[FILE: ops_codes.json]\n[FILE: patient_pathological_data.json]\n[FILE: patient_clinical_data.json]\n[FILE: history_text.txt]\n[FILE: icd_codes.json]\n[FILE: patient_blood_data.json]\n[FILE: blood_data_reference_ranges.json]Remember that you can ask for files by providing the following tag [REQUEST: filename.extension].
