The surgery was complicated by severe postradiogenic changes, including a narrow esophageal lumen and fragile mucosa, which made visualization and certain procedures, such as nasogastric tube placement, very challenging. During the tumor resection at the left edge of the tongue, the initial frozen section revealed carcinoma at the posterior and medial margin. A second resection was performed in this area, and the subsequent frozen section confirmed an R0 resection (complete tumor removal with negative margins). Additional attention was given to a fistula at the upper lateral edge of the tracheostoma, which was treated with curettage, biopsy, and the application of granulation-promoting dressing material. The procedure was completed without complications, and final histopathological evaluation is awaited for further case discussion in the tumor board.\nNew files available:\n[FILE: PrimaryTumor_HE_176.jpg]\n[FILE: PrimaryTumor_HE_176_roi.jpg]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD3_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD3_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD8_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD8_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD56_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD56_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD68_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD68_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD163_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD163_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_HE_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_HE_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_MHC1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_MHC1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_PDL1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_PDL1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD3_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD3_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD8_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD8_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD56_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD56_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD68_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD68_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD163_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD163_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_HE_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_HE_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_MHC1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_MHC1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_PDL1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_PDL1_1.png]\n[FILE: surgery_report.txt]\n[FILE: surgery_descriptions.txt]\n[FILE: ops_codes.json]\n[FILE: patient_pathological_data.json]\n[FILE: patient_clinical_data.json]\n[FILE: history_text.txt]\n[FILE: icd_codes.json]\n[FILE: patient_blood_data.json]\n[FILE: blood_data_reference_ranges.json]Remember that you can ask for files by providing the following tag [REQUEST: filename.extension].

There is a slight elevation in MCHC and a low lymphocyte percentage, but these are not major concerns.\n   - **Other Parameters:** Urea is slightly below the normal range, but this is not typically a significant concern.\n\n2. **Clinical Data:**\n   - The patient is a 66-year-old male, non-smoker, diagnosed with oropharyngeal wall carcinoma in 2019.\n   - The tumor is a keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with a pT2 stage, G3 grading, and perineural invasion.\n\n3. **Surgical Report:**\n   - The surgery involved laser resection of the oropharyngeal wall carcinoma, bilateral neck dissection, and tracheotomy.\n   - An R0 resection was achieved, indicating complete tumor removal with negative margins.\n   - The procedure was complicated by severe postradiogenic changes, including a narrow esophageal lumen and fragile mucosa.\n\n4. **Pathological Data:**\n   - The primary tumor site is the oral cavity.\n   - The tumor is a conventional keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma.\n   - There is evidence of perineural invasion, which is a significant prognostic factor.\n\nGiven these findings, the patient's prognosis is influenced by several factors:\n- **Complete Tumor Resection (R0):** Achieving an R0 resection is a positive prognostic factor.\n- **Perineural Invasion:** This is a negative prognostic factor and may indicate a higher risk of recurrence.\n- **Histologic Grade (G3):** High-grade tumors are generally associated with a poorer prognosis.\n- **Age and General Health:** The patient is 66 years old and appears to have no significant comorbidities based on the blood test results.\n\nConsidering these factors, while the patient has achieved a complete resection, the presence of perineural invasion and high-grade tumor characteristics suggest a more guarded prognosis. However, the absence of significant comorbidities and the successful surgical outcome are positive indicators.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"

Carrying out the team time-out with the anesthesia colleagues and induction of intubation anesthesia by the colleagues. Induction of anesthesia through the existing tracheostoma. Now attempt panendoscopy. The patient is extremely difficult to view with the small bore tube due to the severe postradiogenic changes. No abnormalities in the hypopharynx and supraglottic larynx as far as can be assessed. The glottis cannot be adequately assessed, nor can the esophageal opening. A flexible gastroesophagoscopy is not performed as the mucosa is very vulnerable to contact and the lumen is very narrow. Closer inspection with the small flexible scope reveals an almost obliterated esophageal lumen. The placement of a nasogastric tube is also frustrating after several attempts. The tumor is now resected at the edge of the tongue on the left side with a safety margin of approx. 1 cm. Removal of the specimen under constant blood control using bipolar coagulation forceps and palpatory control. Now mark the suture and send the specimen for frozen section examination. After receipt of the frozen section findings, it is found that there is still carcinoma forming the margin in the specimen in the area of the posterior and medial margin (up to the central specimen). The decision is now made to perform a resection. The resection is performed from posterior to mid-medial and the specimen is again sent in thread-marked for histological frozen section examination. The 2nd frozen section is now reliably tumor-free. In summary, an R0 resection can therefore be assumed. Subtle hemostasis using bipolar coagulation forceps and completion of the procedure without complications. Finally, inspection of the fistula at the upper lateral edge of the tracheostoma on the left side. This shows a fistula channel approx. 2-3 mm wide, which is sharpened with the curette after obtaining a sample biopsy and a granulation-promoting dressing material is inserted.

        "content": "Based on the comprehensive review of the patient's blood test results, clinical data, pathological data, and surgical reports, the following key points can be summarized:\n\n1. **Blood Test Results:**\n   - **Renal Function:** Creatinine and GFR are within normal ranges, indicating no significant renal impairment.\n   - **Electrolytes:** Sodium and potassium levels are within normal ranges, indicating no electrolyte imbalances.\n   - **Hematology:** Hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, and coagulation markers (PT, aPTT, INR) are within normal ranges. There is a slight elevation in MCHC and a low lymphocyte percentage, but these are not major concerns.\n   - **Other Parameters:** Urea is slightly below the normal range, but this is not typically a significant concern.\n\n2. **Clinical Data:**\n   - The patient is a 66-year-old male, non-smoker, diagnosed with oropharyngeal wall carcinoma in 2019.\n   - The tumor is a keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with a pT2 stage, G3 grading, and perineural invasion.\n\n3. **Surgical Report:**\n   - The surgery involved laser resection of the oropharyngeal wall carcinoma, bilateral neck dissection, and tracheotomy.\n   - An R0 resection was achieved, indicating complete tumor removal with negative margins.\n   - The procedure was complicated by severe postradiogenic changes, including a narrow esophageal lumen and fragile mucosa.\n\n4. **Pathological Data:**\n   - The primary tumor site is the oral cavity.\n   - The tumor is a conventional keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma.\n   - There is evidence of perineural invasion, which is a significant prognostic factor.\n\nGiven these findings, the patient's prognosis is influenced by several factors:\n- **Complete Tumor Resection (R0):** Achieving an R0 resection is a positive prognostic factor.\n- **Perineural Invasion:** This is a negative prognostic factor and may indicate a higher risk of recurrence.\n- **Histologic Grade (G3):** High-grade tumors are generally associated with a higher risk of recurrence.\n- **Age and General Health:** The patient is 66 years old and appears to have no significant comorbidities based on the blood test results.\n\nConsidering these factors, while the patient has achieved a complete resection, the presence of perineural invasion and high-grade tumor characteristics suggest a higher risk of recurrence within 2 years.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"
