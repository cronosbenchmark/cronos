        "content": "Based on the provided histopathology images and the immunohistochemical (IHC) stainings, we can analyze the characteristics of the tumor to determine its most likely histologic type.\n\n1. **Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) Staining:**\n   - The H&E images (PrimaryTumor_HE_706.jpg and PrimaryTumor_HE_706_roi.jpg) show a dense, irregularly shaped mass with a high cellularity. The cells appear to be arranged in nests and sheets, which is characteristic of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).\n   - The presence of keratinization or keratin pearls, which are often seen in SCC, can be inferred from the dense, eosinophilic areas within the tumor.\n\n2. **Immunohistochemical Stainings:**\n   - **CD3 and CD8 Stainings (TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD3_0.png, TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD3_1.png, TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD8_0.png, TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD8_1.png):** These stainings highlight the presence of T-cells and cytotoxic T-cells, respectively, within the tumor microenvironment. This is common in SCC, which often has an inflammatory infiltrate.\n   - **CD56 Staining (TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD56_0.png, TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD56_1.png):** CD56 is a marker for natural killer (NK) cells and neuroendocrine cells. The lack of significant CD56 staining suggests that the tumor is not of neuroendocrine origin, ruling out small cell carcinoma.\n   - **CD68 and CD163 Stainings (TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD68_0.png, TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD68_1.png, TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD163_0.png, TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD163_1.png):** These markers are for macrophages. The presence of macrophages is common in the tumor microenvironment of SCC.\n   - **MHC1 Staining (TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_MHC1_0.png, TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_MHC1_1.png):** MHC1 is typically expressed on the surface of most nucleated cells and is involved in antigen presentation. The staining pattern can help in identifying the immune response within the tumor.\n   - **PDL1 Staining (TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_PDL1_0.png, TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_PDL1_1.png):** PDL1 expression is often seen in SCC and can be a marker for immune evasion by the tumor.\n\n3. **Exclusion of Other Types:**\n   - **Adenocarcinoma (A):** Typically shows glandular structures and mucin production, which are not observed in the provided images.\n   - **Lymphoma (E):** Would show a monotonous population of lymphoid cells, which is not the case here.\n   - **Melanoma (F):** Would show melanin-producing cells and a different staining pattern, which is not observed.\n\nBased on the morphological features in the H&E staining and the immunohistochemical profile, the most likely histologic type of the tumor is **Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)**. The lack of keratinization in some areas suggests it is more likely to be **Conventional-NonKeratinizing SCC** rather than keratinizing SCC.\n\n[ANSWER: C) SCC, Conventional-NonKeratinizing]"

The surgery involved transoral resection of the tumor with a safety margin of 1-1.5 cm, followed by additional laser resection due to microscopic tumor infiltrates in the caudal tongue base, vallecula, and hypopharyngeal regions. Achieving an R0 resection (no residual tumor) was confirmed after further marginal sampling. Bilateral neck dissection was performed, with the removal of lymph nodes from levels II through V on both sides, revealing several conspicuous lymph nodes, particularly in level II. The procedure also included a tracheostomy for airway management and placement of a transnasal feeding tube for postoperative nutrition, as PEG insertion was not feasible due to prior abdominal surgery and the presence of a Vicryl mesh. The patient was admitted to the ICU for postoperative monitoring, with a diagnosis of N2b status on the right side.
