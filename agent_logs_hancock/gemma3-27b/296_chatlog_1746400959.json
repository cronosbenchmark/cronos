The procedure included a transcervical and transoral resection with clear tumor-free margins (R0 resection). Bilateral neck dissections were performed (Level 1-5 on the left and Level 2-5 on the right), preserving critical neurovascular structures. The defect left by the resection was reconstructed using a free anterolateral thigh (ALT) flap, with successful vascular anastomosis confirmed intraoperatively. Additional procedures included the creation of a tracheostomy and placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube for postoperative nutrition. The patient experienced intraoperative hemodynamic instability requiring catecholamine support. Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for stabilization, with ongoing anticoagulation and antibiotic therapy. Early flap monitoring via Doppler and enoral inspection was planned.
