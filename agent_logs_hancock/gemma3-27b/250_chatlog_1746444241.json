The resection was extended to achieve an R0 resection (tumor-free margins), as confirmed by frozen section analysis. Bilateral neck dissections were performed, including a modified radical neck dissection on the left (levels Ib\u2013V) and selective neck dissection on the right (levels II\u2013IV), with removal of metastatic lymph nodes. A tracheotomy was also performed for airway management.  \n\nDefect reconstruction involved the use of a microvascular radial forearm free flap harvested from the right arm and transferred to the oral cavity and oropharyngeal defect. The vascular pedicle was successfully anastomosed to the superior thyroid artery and the facial vein using microsurgical techniques, ensuring strong arterial flow and venous return. The donor site on the forearm was reconstructed with a full-thickness skin graft from the left groin. The surgery was completed without complications, and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Multimodal management, including antibiotics (Unacid) and anticoagulation therapy (Heparin), was initiated. Postoperative care includes regular monitoring of the vascular pedicle, feeding through a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube for 10 days, and gradual dietary progression.\nNew files available:\n[FILE: PrimaryTumor_HE_250.jpg]\n[FILE: PrimaryTumor_HE_250_roi.jpg]\n[FILE: LymphNode_HE_250.jpg]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD3_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD3_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD8_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD8_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD56_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD56_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD68_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD68_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD163_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD163_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_HE_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_HE_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_MHC1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_MHC1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_PDL1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_PDL1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD3_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD3_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD8_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD8_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD56_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD56_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD68_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD68_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD163_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD163_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_HE_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_HE_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_MHC1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_MHC1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_PDL1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_PDL1_1.png]\n[FILE: surgery_report.txt]\n[FILE: surgery_descriptions.txt]\n[FILE: ops_codes.json]\n[FILE: patient_pathological_data.json]\n[FILE: patient_clinical_data.json]\n[FILE: history_text.txt]\n[FILE: icd_codes.json]\n[FILE: patient_blood_data.json]\n[FILE: blood_data_reference_ranges.json]Remember that you can ask for files by providing the following tag [REQUEST: filename.extension].

N2b signifies metastasis in >6 lymph nodes or extranodal extension.\n*   **HPV Negative:** The tumor is HPV-negative. HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers generally have a better prognosis.\n*   **Perineural Invasion:** Presence of perineural invasion (Pn+) suggests a more aggressive tumor behavior.\n*   **Lymphovascular Invasion:** Presence of lymphovascular invasion (L+) indicates a higher risk of distant metastasis.\n*   **Smoking History:** The patient has a significant smoking history, which is a risk factor for recurrence.\n*   **CD163+ Macrophages:** High CD163+ macrophage infiltration suggests an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, potentially hindering anti-tumor immunity.\n*   **Limited CD8+ T-cell Infiltration:** While some CD8+ T-cell infiltration is present at the invasion front, it's not overwhelmingly abundant, suggesting a limited cytotoxic immune response.\n*   **Extensive Surgery:** While R0 resection is achieved, the extensive surgery (transoral resection, bilateral neck dissections, tracheostomy, and free flap reconstruction) indicates a significant burden of disease and carries its own risks and potential complications.\n\n**Factors suggesting a potentially better prognosis:**\n\n*   **R0 Resection:** Achieving a complete resection (R0) is a critical positive factor.\n*   **Modified Radical Neck Dissection:** Thorough lymph node dissection reduces the risk of regional recurrence.\n*   **Microvascular Reconstruction:** Successful reconstruction with a radial forearm free flap restores function and quality of life.\n\n**PD-L1 Expression:** The PD-L1 IHC images show some positive staining, but the level of expression needs to be quantified to determine if the patient might benefit from immunotherapy.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nConsidering the totality of the information, particularly the advanced stage, HPV-negative status, presence of perineural and lymphovascular invasion, and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, the patient faces a significant risk of recurrence and distant metastasis.
