The small tumor size, complete resection, and absence of invasion are strong positive indicators. However, the aggressive histology (G3) and HPV-negative status are concerning. Overall, the patient has a reasonable chance of surviving 5 years, assuming no regional or distant metastasis develops.\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"
