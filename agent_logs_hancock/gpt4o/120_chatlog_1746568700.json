This finding is mild and unlikely to significantly impact oxygen delivery during and after surgery.\n\n[ANSWER: B) The mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) is below normal, suggesting hypochromic anemia.]"

The surgery involved a transcervical resection of the tumor, which extended laterally into the hypopharyngeal region and involved the right lingual artery. To ensure adequate clearance, bilateral selective neck dissections were performed (regions I-V on the right and regions II-V on the left), preserving non-lymphatic structures, except for the right lingual artery, which was resected due to tumor involvement. The resulting 7 x 5.5 cm defect was reconstructed using a microvascularly anastomosed radial forearm free flap from the left arm, with arterial anastomosis to the superior thyroid artery and venous anastomosis to the internal jugular vein. A split-thickness skin graft from the right thigh was used to cover the donor site on the left forearm. Additional procedures included a tracheotomy for airway management and placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube for nutritional support. Intraoperative margins were confirmed to be tumor-free via frozen section analysis. The flap was confirmed to be viable, and all anastomoses were patent at the end of the procedure. Radiotherapy has been planned as the next step in the treatment plan.\nNew files available:\n[FILE: PrimaryTumor_HE_120.jpg]\n[FILE: PrimaryTumor_HE_120_roi.jpg]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD3_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD3_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD8_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD8_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD56_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD56_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD68_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD68_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD163_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD163_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_HE_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_HE_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_MHC1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_MHC1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_PDL1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_PDL1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD3_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD3_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD8_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD8_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD56_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD56_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD68_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD68_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD163_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD163_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_HE_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_HE_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_MHC1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_MHC1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_PDL1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_PDL1_1.png]\n[FILE: surgery_report.txt]\n[FILE: surgery_descriptions.txt]\n[FILE: ops_codes.json]\n[FILE: patient_pathological_data.json]\n[FILE: patient_clinical_data.json]\n[FILE: history_text.txt]\n[FILE: icd_codes.json]\n[FILE: patient_blood_data.json]\n[FILE: blood_data_reference_ranges.json]Remember that you can ask for files by providing the following tag [REQUEST: filename.extension].

However, the HPV-negative status and poor differentiation of the tumor are concerns.\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"
