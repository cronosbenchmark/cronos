The cells appear to be arranged in nests and cords, which is characteristic of squamous cell carcinoma. There is no evidence of glandular differentiation, which rules out adenocarcinoma. The absence of small, round blue cells rules out small cell carcinoma. The lack of a lymphoid infiltrate and the absence of large, atypical cells with prominent nucleoli make lymphoma less likely. There are no pigmented cells, which makes melanoma less likely.\n\n2. **Lymph Node (LymphNode_HE_706.jpg)**: The lymph node image shows a reactive lymph node with no evidence of metastatic tumor.

Prior to surgery, a comprehensive panel of blood tests was performed to evaluate organ function, clotting ability, and overall systemic health. These tests are crucial to identify any potential risks, such as impaired renal function, electrolyte imbalances, or hematologic abnormalities, that could complicate the surgical procedure or postoperative recovery. The results of these tests need to be analyzed carefully to optimize the patient's perioperative care.\nNew files available:\n[FILE: PrimaryTumor_HE_706.jpg]\n[FILE: PrimaryTumor_HE_706_roi.jpg]\n[FILE: LymphNode_HE_706.jpg]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD3_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD3_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD8_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD8_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD56_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD56_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD68_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD68_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD163_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD163_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_HE_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_HE_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_MHC1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_MHC1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_PDL1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_PDL1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD3_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD3_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD8_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD8_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD56_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD56_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD68_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD68_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD163_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD163_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_HE_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_HE_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_MHC1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_MHC1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_PDL1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_PDL1_1.png]\n[FILE: patient_blood_data.json]\n[FILE: blood_data_reference_ranges.json]\n[FILE: patient_pathological_data.json]\n[FILE: icd_codes.json]Remember that you can ask for files by providing the following tag [REQUEST: filename.extension].

The surgery involved transoral resection of the tumor with a safety margin of 1-1.5 cm, followed by additional laser resection due to microscopic tumor infiltrates in the caudal tongue base, vallecula, and hypopharyngeal regions. Achieving an R0 resection (no residual tumor) was confirmed after further marginal sampling. Bilateral neck dissection was performed, with the removal of lymph nodes from levels II through V on both sides, revealing several conspicuous lymph nodes, particularly in level II. The procedure also included a tracheostomy for airway management and placement of a transnasal feeding tube for postoperative nutrition, as PEG insertion was not feasible due to prior abdominal surgery and the presence of a Vicryl mesh. The patient was admitted to the ICU for postoperative monitoring, with a diagnosis of N2b status on the right side.
