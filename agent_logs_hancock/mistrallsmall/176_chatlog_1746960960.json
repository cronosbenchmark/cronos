The surgery was complicated by severe postradiogenic changes, including a narrow esophageal lumen and fragile mucosa, which made visualization and certain procedures, such as nasogastric tube placement, very challenging. During the tumor resection at the left edge of the tongue, the initial frozen section revealed carcinoma at the posterior and medial margin. A second resection was performed in this area, and the subsequent frozen section confirmed an R0 resection (complete tumor removal with negative margins). Additional attention was given to a fistula at the upper lateral edge of the tracheostoma, which was treated with curettage, biopsy, and the application of granulation-promoting dressing material. The procedure was completed without complications, and final histopathological evaluation is awaited for further case discussion in the tumor board.\nNew files available:\n[FILE: PrimaryTumor_HE_176.jpg]\n[FILE: PrimaryTumor_HE_176_roi.jpg]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD3_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD3_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD8_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD8_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD56_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD56_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD68_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD68_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD163_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD163_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_HE_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_HE_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_MHC1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_MHC1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_PDL1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_PDL1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD3_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD3_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD8_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD8_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD56_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD56_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD68_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD68_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD163_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD163_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_HE_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_HE_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_MHC1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_MHC1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_PDL1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_PDL1_1.png]\n[FILE: surgery_report.txt]\n[FILE: surgery_descriptions.txt]\n[FILE: ops_codes.json]\n[FILE: patient_pathological_data.json]\n[FILE: patient_clinical_data.json]\n[FILE: history_text.txt]\n[FILE: icd_codes.json]\n[FILE: patient_blood_data.json]\n[FILE: blood_data_reference_ranges.json]Remember that you can ask for files by providing the following tag [REQUEST: filename.extension].

High-grade tumors generally have a poorer prognosis.\n- **Resection Status**: Achieving an R0 resection is a positive factor, as it indicates complete tumor removal with negative margins.\n- **Perineural Invasion**: The presence of perineural invasion is associated with a higher risk of recurrence and poorer prognosis.\n- **Age and Comorbidities**: The patient is 66 years old and has significant postradiogenic changes, which may impact overall health and recovery but does not directly affect the tumor prognosis.\n\nConsidering these factors, the patient's prognosis is guarded. High-grade tumors with perineural invasion, even when completely resected, have a higher risk of recurrence and poorer long-term survival. However, the absence of lymphovascular invasion and the achievement of an R0 resection are positive indicators.\n\nGiven the complexity and the high-grade nature of the tumor, it is challenging to definitively predict the patient's 5-year survival without additional follow-up data. However, based on the available information, the likelihood of the patient being alive in 5 years is uncertain and depends on close monitoring and potential adjuvant therapies.\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"

Carrying out the team time-out with the anesthesia colleagues and induction of intubation anesthesia by the colleagues. Induction of anesthesia through the existing tracheostoma. Now attempt panendoscopy. The patient is extremely difficult to view with the small bore tube due to the severe postradiogenic changes. No abnormalities in the hypopharynx and supraglottic larynx as far as can be assessed. The glottis cannot be adequately assessed, nor can the esophageal opening. A flexible gastroesophagoscopy is not performed as the mucosa is very vulnerable to contact and the lumen is very narrow. Closer inspection with the small flexible scope reveals an almost obliterated esophageal lumen. The placement of a nasogastric tube is also frustrating after several attempts. The tumor is now resected at the edge of the tongue on the left side with a safety margin of approx. 1 cm. Removal of the specimen under constant blood control using bipolar coagulation forceps and palpatory control. Now mark the suture and send the specimen for frozen section examination. After receipt of the frozen section findings, it is found that there is still carcinoma forming the margin in the specimen in the area of the posterior and medial margin (up to the central specimen). The decision is now made to perform a resection. The resection is performed from posterior to mid-medial and the specimen is again sent in thread-marked for histological frozen section examination. The 2nd frozen section is now reliably tumor-free. In summary, an R0 resection can therefore be assumed. Subtle hemostasis using bipolar coagulation forceps and completion of the procedure without complications. Finally, inspection of the fistula at the upper lateral edge of the tracheostoma on the left side. This shows a fistula channel approx. 2-3 mm wide, which is sharpened with the curette after obtaining a sample biopsy and a granulation-promoting dressing material is inserted.

However, the achievement of an R0 resection is a positive indicator.\n\nGiven the complexity and the high-grade nature of the tumor, the likelihood of recurrence within 2 years is significant. Close monitoring and potential adjuvant therapies will be crucial in managing the patient's risk of recurrence.\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"
