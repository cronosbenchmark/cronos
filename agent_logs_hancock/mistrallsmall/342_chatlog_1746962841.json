This suggests a low level of PDL1-mediated immune evasion.\n\n2. **CD8+ T-cell Infiltration**:\n   - The CD8 staining indicates a moderate to high density of cytotoxic T-cells, particularly at the invasion front. This suggests an active immune response against the tumor.\n\n3. **CD163 Expression**:\n   - The CD163 staining shows a higher density of macrophages, particularly at the invasion front. CD163 is a marker for M2 macrophages, which are often associated with an immunosuppressive microenvironment.\n\n4. **MHC1 Expression**:\n   - The MHC1 staining shows variable expression, with some areas of the tumor exhibiting lower levels of MHC1, which can contribute to immune evasion.\n\n5. **CD56 Expression**:\n   - The CD56 staining shows very few CD56-positive cells, indicating a low presence of natural killer (NK) cells in both the tumor center and the invasion front.\n\n6. **CD68 Expression**:\n   - The CD68 staining shows a moderate number of CD68-positive cells in both the tumor center and the invasion front, indicating the presence of macrophages in both regions.\n\n7. **H&E Staining**:\n   - The H&E images show the general morphology of the tumor. The invasion front appears to have more stromal reaction and inflammatory infiltrate, which is consistent with the increased presence of macrophages observed in the IHC staining.\n\nBased on these observations, the tumor exhibits features of an immunosuppressive microenvironment due to the high macrophage density (CD163) and variable MHC1 expression, despite the presence of cytotoxic T-cells (CD8). The low PDL1 expression suggests that PDL1 is not the primary mechanism of immune evasion in this case.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is:\n\n[ANSWER: C) The tumor evades immune response through macrophage polarization and low PDL1 expression]"

The early stage and complete resection are positive indicators, but the high-grade nature of the tumor and the relatively close resection margin suggest a need for close follow-up and possibly adjuvant therapy. The absence of lymph node involvement (NX) and distant metastasis (not mentioned) are also favorable.\n\nBased on the available information, it is challenging to definitively predict the patient's risk of recurrence within 2 years. However, considering the early stage, complete resection, and absence of invasion, the risk of recurrence is moderate. Close follow-up and monitoring are essential to detect any potential recurrence early.\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"
