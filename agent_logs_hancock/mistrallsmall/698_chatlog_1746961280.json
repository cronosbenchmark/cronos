The surgeries included laser resection of the primary tumor, neck dissection, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. During the laser resection, the tumor was excised with CO2 laser, including a suspicious mucosal area approximately 1 cm from the main tumor. Margins were resected further due to findings of moderate dysplasia medially and narrow margins basally. Final histology will confirm whether the resection was sufficient. Additionally, a neck dissection was performed on the right side to remove lymph nodes at levels II to IV while preserving critical structures such as the carotid arteries, vagus nerve, and accessory nerve. The PEG was inserted for nutritional support and subsequently loosened postoperatively. The surgery was completed without complications, and antibiotics were prescribed for one week.

Using the CO2 laser with a power of 5-7 watts, the tumor is successively cut around the healthy tissue. In the caudal-medial area, a small mucosal change is seen, which is also suspicious and is about 1 cm away from the main tumor. This is included in the resection. The specimen is then removed and thread-marked and sent for frozen section. A medial margin sample is also taken and sent for frozen section. Medial margin specimen with at least moderate dysplasia according to pathology. Therefore resection recommended. Relatively scarce in the main preparation after basal, although there were microscopically good margins here. Post-resection also recommended here. Therefore, another resection is recommended. A further layer is removed laterally from the muscle wall. A passing nerve, probably the superior laryngeal nerve, is spared. Subsequently, another marginal sample is taken from the medial edge of the temporal bone, in which the dysplasia was detected. Both are sent for final diagnosis. Subsequent careful hemostasis. Repositioning for neck dissection: skin disinfection. Injection of a total of 10 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline. Then sterile draping. Incision in a typical curved fashion in front of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and the digastric muscle.

Therefore, the likelihood of recurrence within 2 years is higher than it would be if these factors were not present.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is:\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"
