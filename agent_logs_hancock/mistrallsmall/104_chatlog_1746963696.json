The surgery included tumor resection with a safety margin, bilateral neck dissection, and reconstruction. On the right side, a large cystic metastatic mass was removed en bloc, necessitating the resection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and sacrifice of the hypoglossal and accessory nerves. Key structures such as the vagus nerve and carotid artery were preserved. On the left side, a neck dissection was performed, sparing critical neurovascular structures. Free flap reconstruction was achieved using a radial forearm flap for the oropharyngeal defect on the left side, and a pectoralis major flap was utilized for defect coverage on the right side of the neck. A tracheotomy was also performed to secure the airway postoperatively. The surgical margins were confirmed to be clear (R0) on frozen section, and no direct contact was observed between the primary tumor and the metastasis. Postoperatively, reconstruction was completed successfully, and the patient remains stable, with flap checks and antibiotics initiated as part of routine care.

However, the clear surgical margins (R0) and the relatively early-stage primary tumor (pT1) are positive indicators.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the likelihood of the patient being alive in 5 years is uncertain but leans towards a less favorable outcome due to the HPV-negative status, extensive lymph node involvement, and the patient's smoking history.\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"

In the pharynx, an extensive exophytic mass can be seen in the area of the oropharynx, in the area of the tonsil lobe, infiltrating the anterior and posterior palatal arch and parts of the soft palate. The other pharyngeal areas and the larynx are unremarkable. Sterile washing and draping. Start with neck dissection on the right and left side in parallel. Right side, start with <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Skin incision so that the large cystic metastasis is cut around. A large area of skin must also be resected. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the caudal region. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and exposure of the capsule of the mass. Dissection of the lower part of the internal jugular vein. Then take over by <CLINICIAN_NAME> and further release of the mass. The mass must be pushed away from the carotid artery. This is achieved without any problems in the area of the common carotid artery. In the bulb area, it can be seen that the external carotid artery is infiltrated by the tumor. The internal jugular vein is then ligated and the mass removed, taking with it the sternocleidomastoid muscle with which the mass has grown together. The hypoglossal nerve is also infiltrated and must be severed as well as the accessorius nerve. The plexus branches of the cervical plexus can be preserved. The vagus nerve can also be preserved. Ultimately, the entire neck preparation with the metastasis is removed en bloc. Only the common carotid artery and internal carotid artery as well as the vagus nerve and the border cord remain. At the same time, perform the neck dissection on the left side through <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Neck dissection on the left: Skin incision, transection of the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue and the platysma. Subplatysmal dissection and elevation of the apron flap. Suturing of the apron flap. Exposure of the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and dissection along the muscle in depth until the cervical plexus is exposed. Identification of the omohyoid muscle and dissection along the muscle to the hyoid bone. Identification of the accessorius nerve and the digastric muscle. Dissection medially to the hyoid bone. Release of the submandibular gland, which is left in place during dissection. Identification of the hypoglossal nerve. This can be safely spared. Dissection along the vein from caudal to cranial and detachment of the neck preparation. Sending in levels II, III, IV and V in individual preparations. Irrigation with hydrogen and Ringer and completion of the neck dissection on the left side without complications. Insertion of the tonsil plug and inspection of the tumor region. Incision of the tumor region with a safety margin of at least 1 cm in the oropharynx using the electric needle. Dissection with the needle as well as with scissors and bipolar forceps. The preparation is obtained en bloc and is placed on cork for frozen section. In the frozen section, all margins and also basal R0. The tumor resection creates a defect towards the neck. The tumor itself had no contact with the large metastasis and was still separated from it by a thin layer of tissue. Now measurement of the defect and lifting of the radialis graft from the left forearm by <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Lifting the radialis graft: Marking the graft on the distal forearm on the left side. S-shaped skin incision and proximal forearm. Exposure of the confluence and dissection of a superficial vein (cephalic vein) up to the radial flap edge. Incision along the marked skin incision down to the forearm fascia. Incision of the forearm fascia and subfascial preparation of the radialis graft. Care is taken to protect the external ramus of the radial nerve, particularly at the radial end. The ulnar artery can also be safely spared. Dissection of the distal section of the radial artery and ligation of the radial artery after prior control by clamping with a vascular clip. A good perfusion signal can be measured on the index finger during clamping. Then preparation of the radial artery graft from the depth under constant bipolar coagulation and placement of vessel clips on the perforator vessels. Dissection up to the crook of the elbow, reliable identification of the brachial artery, the ulnar artery and the interosseous artery. Separation of the radial artery after the exit of the interosseous artery. Separation of the veins and irrigation of the graft with heparin. Lift the split skin from the right thigh using <CLINICIAN_NAME> and <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Insertion of the graft from transcervical and transoral through <CLINICIAN_NAME>. Creation of the arterial and venous anastomosis. Arterial to the superior thyroid artery, venous to the facial vein and a second vein. The anastomosis is located on the left side. The stalk was guided over the larynx to the left. Then skin suture in the area of the left side of the neck and a second graft must be lifted to close the right side of the neck. A pectoralis major graft was harvested from the right side for this purpose. To do this, cut around a skin island 8 x 4 cm medial to the nipple. Then dissect down to the thoracic wall. Lifting of the petoral muscle from the thoracic wall. Detachment of the attachment of the pecotralis muscle from the sternum and humerus. The pedicle is clearly identified. The graft is pulled through a tunnel representing the theoretical deltopectoral flap. The deltopectoral flap was not lifted off, but only tunneled under medially. Dissection of a skin flap in the neck area, which is folded back. Fitting of the pectoralis major graft. Adjustment of the folded back neck skin in the sense of a plastic reconstruction. Beforehand, insertion of a Redon drain and completion of the procedure without complications. After the tumor resection, a tracheotomy was performed between the second and third tracheal cartilage in the usual manner. Insertion of a tracheal cannula. Suturing of the tracheostomy tube. Continue antibiotics for at least 24 hours. Flap checks in the usual manner. Presentation at the tumor conference after receipt of the histology. X-ray pelvic swallow after 14 days.\"\n[FILE: patient_pathological_data.json] included\n{'primary_tumor_site': 'Oropharynx', 'pT_stage': 'pT1', 'pN_stage': 'pN3', 'grading': 'G2',

        "content": "To determine the likelihood of the patient's cancer recurring within 2 years, we need to consider several key factors from the available data:\n\n1. **Tumor Characteristics**:\n   - The primary tumor site is the oropharynx.\n   - The tumor stage is pT1, which indicates a relatively early-stage primary tumor.\n   - The nodal stage is pN3, indicating extensive lymph node involvement.\n   - The tumor is HPV-negative, which generally has a poorer prognosis compared to HPV-positive tumors.\n   - There is perinodal invasion, which can be associated with a higher risk of recurrence.\n   - The histologic type is conventional keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma.\n   - The closest resection margin is 0.2 cm, which is within an acceptable range for an R0 resection.\n\n2. **Surgical Details**:\n   - The patient underwent a major surgical procedure with tumor resection, bilateral neck dissection, and reconstruction.\n   - The surgical margins were confirmed to be clear (R0), which is a positive indicator for long-term survival.\n   - The surgery included the removal of a large cystic metastatic mass on the right side, necessitating the resection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and sacrifice of the hypoglossal and accessory nerves.\n\n3. **Pathological Data**:\n   - The number of positive lymph nodes is 4 out of 31 resected, which is a significant finding.\n   - There is no evidence of lymphovascular invasion (L0) or vascular invasion (V0), which are positive indicators.\n   - There is no evidence of perineural invasion (Pn0), which is a positive indicator.\n\n4. **Clinical Data**:\n   - The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of smoking, which is a significant risk factor for poorer outcomes.\n   - The patient has undergone extensive surgery, including the sacrifice of critical nerves on the right side, which may impact long-term functional outcomes and quality of life.\n\n5. **Blood Test Results**:\n   - The patient has anemia, as indicated by low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, which could impact recovery and overall health.\n   - There is evidence of a significant inflammatory response, as indicated by elevated CRP levels.\n   - The patient does not show evidence of renal dysfunction based on urea and creatinine levels.\n\n6. **Immunohistochemistry (IHC) Findings**:\n   - The tumor center shows a high proportion of CD163+ macrophages, which are associated with tumor-promoting inflammation.\n   - There is significant infiltration of CD8+ T cells at the invasion front, which is generally a positive indicator of immune response against the tumor.\n   - The tumor shows low expression of PDL1, which may indicate a less immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.\n\nGiven the extensive lymph node involvement (pN3), HPV-negative status, perinodal invasion, and the patient's smoking history, the risk of recurrence is relatively high. However, the clear surgical margins (R0) and the absence of lymphovascular and vascular invasion are positive indicators.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the likelihood of the patient's cancer recurring within 2 years is high.\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"
