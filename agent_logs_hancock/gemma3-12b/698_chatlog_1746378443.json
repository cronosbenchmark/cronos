The surgeries included laser resection of the primary tumor, neck dissection, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. During the laser resection, the tumor was excised with CO2 laser, including a suspicious mucosal area approximately 1 cm from the main tumor. Margins were resected further due to findings of moderate dysplasia medially and narrow margins basally. Final histology will confirm whether the resection was sufficient. Additionally, a neck dissection was performed on the right side to remove lymph nodes at levels II to IV while preserving critical structures such as the carotid arteries, vagus nerve, and accessory nerve. The PEG was inserted for nutritional support and subsequently loosened postoperatively. The surgery was completed without complications, and antibiotics were prescribed for one week.

The IHC data supports this.\n\n**Factors suggesting a potentially less favorable prognosis:**\n\n*   **Moderate Dysplasia:** The presence of moderate dysplasia medially raises concern for residual disease or recurrence.\n*   **Narrow Margins Initially:** The initial narrow margins suggest a close call with complete resection.\n*   **LCNEC Histology:** While the IHC data was initially interpreted as LCNEC, the final pathology report is pending.
