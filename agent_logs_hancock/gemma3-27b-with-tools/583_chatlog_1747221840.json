The surgery included a combined transoral and transcervical tumor resection with extended radical neck dissection on both sides, creation of a tracheostoma, and reconstruction with an anterolateral thigh flap. The tumor infiltrated multiple structures, including the hypoglossal nerve, sternocleidomastoid muscle, and cervical soft tissues, necessitating their resection. Marginal samples were taken from various areas, all of which were confirmed tumor-free, achieving an R0 resection (complete tumor removal with negative margins). The defect was reconstructed using a vascularized anterolateral thigh flap, with successful arterial and venous anastomoses. Postoperative care involves intensive monitoring, regular Doppler checks for flap perfusion, feeding via PEG for at least 10 days, and continuation of antibiotics (Unacid) and anticoagulation therapy (Heparin). Postoperative radiochemotherapy (RCT) is planned.\nNew files available:\n [FILE: PrimaryTumor_HE_583.jpg]\n[FILE: PrimaryTumor_HE_583_roi.jpg]\n[FILE: LymphNode_HE_583.jpg]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD3_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD3_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD8_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD8_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD56_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD56_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD68_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD68_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD163_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD163_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_HE_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_HE_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_MHC1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_MHC1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_PDL1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_PDL1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD3_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD3_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD8_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD8_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD56_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD56_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD68_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD68_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD163_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD163_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_HE_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_HE_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_MHC1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_MHC1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_PDL1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_PDL1_1.png]\n[FILE: surgery_report.txt]\n[FILE: surgery_descriptions.txt]\n[FILE: ops_codes.json]\n[FILE: patient_pathological_data.json]\n[FILE: patient_clinical_data.json]\n[FILE: history_text.txt]\n[FILE: icd_codes.json]\n[FILE: patient_blood_data.json]\n[FILE: blood_data_reference_ranges.json]Remember that you can ask for files by providing the following tag [REQUEST: filename.extension].

While an R0 resection is a positive prognostic factor, the aggressive nature of the disease and the extent of surgical intervention suggest a high risk of recurrence and potential complications.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, I believe the patient is unlikely to be alive in 5 years.\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n**Factors increasing the risk of recurrence:**\n\n*   **Advanced Stage (cT4 cN2c):** This indicates a high initial disease burden and a greater likelihood of microscopic residual disease.\n*   **Extensive Surgical Resection:** While R0 resection is positive, the extensive nature of the surgery (involving multiple sites and structures) suggests a complex tumor environment and potential for undetected microscopic disease at the margins or in regional lymph nodes.\n*   **Positive Regional Lymph Nodes (cN2c):** The presence of metastatic disease in regional lymph nodes is a strong predictor of recurrence.\n*   **Planned Adjuvant Radiochemotherapy (RCT):** The need for RCT indicates a high risk of recurrence despite the surgical resection. RCT is used to address the risk of microscopic residual disease.\n*   **PDL1 Expression:** Suggests potential immune evasion, making the tumor less susceptible to immune surveillance and increasing the risk of recurrence.\n*   **Histological Features:** Squamous cell carcinoma, particularly in this location, can be aggressive and prone to recurrence.\n\n**Mitigating Factors:**\n\n*   **R0 Resection:** Complete surgical removal with negative margins is the most important factor reducing recurrence risk. However, it doesn't eliminate the risk entirely, especially in advanced cases.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nDespite achieving an R0 resection, the patient's advanced stage, extensive disease, positive lymph nodes, and the need for adjuvant RCT strongly suggest a high risk of recurrence within 2 years. The aggressive nature of the cancer and the complexity of the surgical intervention contribute to this increased risk.\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"
