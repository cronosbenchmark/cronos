These factors suggest a more aggressive tumor behavior, which could impact long-term survival.\n\nGiven these considerations, the prognosis is mixed, but the achievement of an R0 resection is a significant positive factor.

These factors suggest a more aggressive tumor behavior, which could increase the risk of recurrence.\n\nGiven these considerations, the high-grade nature and perineural invasion suggest a higher risk of recurrence compared to lower-grade tumors without these features. However, the achievement of an R0 resection is a significant positive factor that reduces the immediate risk of recurrence.\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"
