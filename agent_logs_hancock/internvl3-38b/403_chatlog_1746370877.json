This suggests that the tumor cells are capable of presenting antigens to T cells, which is a necessary step for immune recognition.\n- **CD56 Expression**: The images indicate that CD56-positive cells are present, but their distribution and density need to be considered. CD56 is a marker for natural killer (NK) cells and some neuroendocrine cells. The presence of CD56-positive cells could indicate an attempt by the tumor to recruit NK cells, but their effectiveness in immune surveillance would depend on their functional status and interaction with other immune cells.\n\nGiven the high PDL1 expression in the invasion front and the higher T-cell infiltration in the same region, it suggests that the tumor is attempting to evade immune surveillance through immune checkpoint mechanisms (PDL1) rather than through MHC1 downregulation or lack of CD56-positive cells.\n\nTherefore, the most likely scenario is that the tumor demonstrates immune evasion through high PDL1 expression in the invasion front, which can inhibit T-cell activity despite the presence of T cells.\n\n[ANSWER: B) The tumor shows immune evasion through high PDL1 expression in the tumor center and low CD8 infiltration in the invasion front]"

The pathologist reported no evidence of invasive carcinoma or carcinoma in situ, though moderate dysplasia was noted in the lateral area of the specimen. No further resection was performed at this site.  \n\nThe procedure continued with bilateral neck dissections. On the right side, levels II-V were dissected, sparing major structures except for the external jugular vein, and slightly enlarged lymph nodes were removed from level V. On the left side, a large metastatic lymph node was identified at level II (near the border of level Ib) and was resected en bloc. The dissection extended to levels II-V on the left while sparing key nerves and vascular structures, except for the external jugular vein. Redon drains were inserted, and the wound was closed in layers. No gastric tube was required as the defect was localized, and the patient can cautiously begin a liquid or mushy diet.
