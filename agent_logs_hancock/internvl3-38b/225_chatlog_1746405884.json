During the procedure, the tumor was resected with macroscopically healthy margins, but microscopic analysis of the wound bed revealed very close resection margins. Consequently, an additional resection was performed to ensure adequate clearance for final histological evaluation. A tracheotomy was also performed due to the surgical wound area and anatomical challenges, including a short neck and limited neck extension. This involved creating a visor tracheotomy with a mucocutaneous anastomosis and the placement of an 8 mm tracheal cannula. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring.
