The postcricoid region also opens well and is free. In Cormack I, the vocal folds are easily adjustable up to the anterior commissure and are also inconspicuous. The Mc Ivor blade is now inserted and the mass removed by excisional biopsy with the helium laser. Care is taken to ensure that there is an approx. 1 cm margin around the mass. The left half of the uvula is missing. The tonsil itself is very small and remains intact. The specimen is marked with sutures and a resection is made in the lateral part if the mucosa hardens.
