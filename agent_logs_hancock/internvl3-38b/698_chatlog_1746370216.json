The surgeries included laser resection of the primary tumor, neck dissection, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. During the laser resection, the tumor was excised with CO2 laser, including a suspicious mucosal area approximately 1 cm from the main tumor. Margins were resected further due to findings of moderate dysplasia medially and narrow margins basally. Final histology will confirm whether the resection was sufficient. Additionally, a neck dissection was performed on the right side to remove lymph nodes at levels II to IV while preserving critical structures such as the carotid arteries, vagus nerve, and accessory nerve. The PEG was inserted for nutritional support and subsequently loosened postoperatively. The surgery was completed without complications, and antibiotics were prescribed for one week. The case will be reviewed at an interdisciplinary tumor conference following final histopathology results.\nNew files available:\n[FILE: PrimaryTumor_HE_698.jpg]\n[FILE: PrimaryTumor_HE_698_roi.jpg]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD3_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD3_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD8_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD8_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD56_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD56_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD68_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD68_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD163_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD163_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_HE_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_HE_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_MHC1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_MHC1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_PDL1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_PDL1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD3_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD3_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD8_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD8_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD56_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD56_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD68_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD68_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD163_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD163_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_HE_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_HE_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_MHC1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_MHC1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_PDL1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_PDL1_1.png]\n[FILE: surgery_report.txt]\n[FILE: surgery_descriptions.txt]\n[FILE: ops_codes.json]\n[FILE: patient_pathological_data.json]\n[FILE: patient_clinical_data.json]\n[FILE: history_text.txt]\n[FILE: icd_codes.json]\n[FILE: patient_blood_data.json]\n[FILE: blood_data_reference_ranges.json]Remember that you can ask for files by providing the following tag [REQUEST: filename.extension].

The small tumor is located in the area of the transition from the base of the tongue to the pharyngeal side wall or the transition from the oropharyngeal side wall to the hypopharyngeal side wall. Therefore, the above-mentioned surgery is now indicated.\"\n[FILE: surgery_report.txt] included\n\"Initial PEG insertion: insertion with the gastroscope. After creating the diaphanoscopy, easy insertion of a 15 mm abdominal wall tube. Typical fixation to the abdominal wall. Subsequent repositioning for laser resection: insertion with the spreading laryngoscope. Exposure of the tumor, which is successful. Using the CO2 laser with a power of 5-7 watts, the tumor is successively cut around the healthy tissue. In the caudal-medial area, a small mucosal change is seen, which is also suspicious and is about 1 cm away from the main tumor. This is included in the resection. The specimen is then removed and thread-marked and sent for frozen section. A medial margin sample is also taken and sent for frozen section. Medial margin specimen with at least moderate dysplasia according to pathology. Therefore resection recommended. Relatively scarce in the main preparation after basal, although there were microscopically good margins here. Post-resection also recommended here. Therefore, another resection is recommended. A further layer is removed laterally from the muscle wall. A passing nerve, probably the superior laryngeal nerve, is spared. Subsequently, another marginal sample is taken from the medial edge of the temporal bone, in which the dysplasia was detected. Both are sent for final diagnosis. Subsequent careful hemostasis. Repositioning for neck dissection: skin disinfection. Injection of a total of 10 ml Ultracaine 1% with adrenaline. Then sterile draping. Incision in a typical curved fashion in front of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Exposure of the omohyoid muscle and the digastric muscle. Exposure of the internal jugular vein, external jugular vein, internal/external carotid artery, vagus nerve, hypoglossal nerve and accessorius nerve. Successive removal of the level II to IV lymph nodes while exposing and preserving the branches of the cervical plexus. Subsequent careful hemostasis. Wound closure in layers with insertion of a Redon drain. Completion of the procedure without complications. Check the enoral situation again at the end. No bleeding here. Overall small carcinoma at the oro-/hypopharyngeal junction, which was resected again basally due to a narrow margin and medially due to dysplasia. Neck dissection on the right. Postoperative loosening of the PEG in a typical manner on the following day. Antibiotics, which were given, should be continued for one week. After receiving the final histology, further procedure or presentation at the interdisciplinary tumor conference.\"\n",

        "content": "Based on the provided patient information, the patient has a small oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (pT1, pN0) with an R0 resection status, indicating that the tumor was completely removed with clear margins. The patient is HPV-positive (p16-positive), which is associated with a better prognosis compared to HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancers. Additionally, the patient is a non-smoker, which is another favorable prognostic factor.\n\nThe patient underwent successful surgical resection of the primary tumor, neck dissection, and PEG placement without complications. The absence of lymph node involvement (pN0) and the small size of the tumor (pT1) further contribute to a favorable prognosis.\n\nGiven these factors, the patient's 2-year recurrence risk is relatively low. The combination of a small tumor size, clear resection margins, HPV positivity, and non-smoking status all contribute to a lower likelihood of recurrence within the next 2 years.\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"
