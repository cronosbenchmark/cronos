The surgery included tumor resection with a safety margin, bilateral neck dissection, and reconstruction. On the right side, a large cystic metastatic mass was removed en bloc, necessitating the resection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and sacrifice of the hypoglossal and accessory nerves. Key structures such as the vagus nerve and carotid artery were preserved. On the left side, a neck dissection was performed, sparing critical neurovascular structures. Free flap reconstruction was achieved using a radial forearm flap for the oropharyngeal defect on the left side, and a pectoralis major flap was utilized for defect coverage on the right side of the neck. A tracheotomy was also performed to secure the airway postoperatively. The surgical margins were confirmed to be clear (R0) on frozen section, and no direct contact was observed between the primary tumor and the metastasis. Postoperatively, reconstruction was completed successfully, and the patient remains stable, with flap checks and antibiotics initiated as part of routine care. The case will be reviewed in a tumor board conference following histopathology results.\nNew files available:\n[FILE: PrimaryTumor_HE_104.jpg]\n[FILE: PrimaryTumor_HE_104_roi.jpg]\n[FILE: LymphNode_HE_104.jpg]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD3_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD3_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD8_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD8_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD56_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD56_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD68_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD68_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD163_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD163_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_HE_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_HE_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_MHC1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_MHC1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_PDL1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_PDL1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD3_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD3_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD8_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD8_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD56_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD56_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD68_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD68_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD163_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD163_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_HE_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_HE_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_MHC1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_MHC1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_PDL1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_PDL1_1.png]\n[FILE: surgery_report.txt]\n[FILE: surgery_descriptions.txt]\n[FILE: ops_codes.json]\n[FILE: patient_pathological_data.json]\n[FILE: patient_clinical_data.json]\n[FILE: history_text.txt]\n[FILE: icd_codes.json]\n[FILE: patient_blood_data.json]\n[FILE: blood_data_reference_ranges.json]Remember that you can ask for files by providing the following tag [REQUEST: filename.extension].

The HPV-negative status also suggests a less favorable prognosis compared to HPV-positive cases. However, the clear surgical margins (R0) and successful reconstruction are positive factors.\n\nGiven these factors, the prognosis is guarded. While the early T stage and clear margins are favorable, the advanced nodal stage and HPV-negative status increase the risk of recurrence and metastasis.\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"
