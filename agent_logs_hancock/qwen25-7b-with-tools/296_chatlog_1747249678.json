        "content": "You are given the following new patient information: \nThe patient underwent an extensive surgical procedure for a locally advanced oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (cT4), which involved wide tumor resection due to its extensive and multicentric growth. The tumor extended from the right palatal arch to the base of the tongue, posterior pharyngeal wall, left vallecula, epiglottis, and piriform sinus. The procedure included a transcervical and transoral resection with clear tumor-free margins (R0 resection). Bilateral neck dissections were performed (Level 1-5 on the left and Level 2-5 on the right), preserving critical neurovascular structures. The defect left by the resection was reconstructed using a free anterolateral thigh (ALT) flap, with successful vascular anastomosis confirmed intraoperatively. Additional procedures included the creation of a tracheostomy and placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube for postoperative nutrition. The patient experienced intraoperative hemodynamic instability requiring catecholamine support. Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for stabilization, with ongoing anticoagulation and antibiotic therapy. Early flap monitoring via Doppler and enoral inspection was planned. Given the tumor's extent, postoperative radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy is strongly recommended for adjuvant treatment.\nNew files available:\n [FILE: PrimaryTumor_HE_296.jpg]\n[FILE: PrimaryTumor_HE_296_roi.jpg]\n[FILE: LymphNode_HE_296.jpg]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD3_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD3_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD8_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD8_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD56_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD56_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD68_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD68_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD163_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD163_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_HE_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_HE_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_MHC1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_MHC1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_PDL1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_PDL1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD3_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD3_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD8_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD8_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD56_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD56_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD68_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD68_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD163_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD163_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_HE_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_HE_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_MHC1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_MHC1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_PDL1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_PDL1_1.png]\n[FILE: surgery_report.txt]\n[FILE: surgery_descriptions.txt]\n[FILE: ops_codes.json]\n[FILE: patient_pathological_data.json]\n[FILE: patient_clinical_data.json]\n[FILE: history_text.txt]\n[FILE: icd_codes.json]\n[FILE: patient_blood_data.json]\n[FILE: blood_data_reference_ranges.json]Remember that you can ask for files by providing the following tag [REQUEST: filename.extension].
