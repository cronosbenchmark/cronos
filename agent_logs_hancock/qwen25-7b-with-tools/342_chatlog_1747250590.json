You may also ask for multiple files at once if necessary. If you ask for a file, you MUST WAIT to receive it from the user.\nYou must provide a separate [REQUEST] tag for each file you need. Example [REQUEST: image1.jpg] [REQUEST: image2.jpg].\nYou can also use the CONCH model to determine cancer type or invasion by providing the H&E image name and extension and a list of options. Example: [CONCH: image1.jpg, (melanoma), (squamous cell carcinoma)] [CONCH: image2.jpg, (option 1), (option 2)].\nThe model will then tell you which option resembles the image the most.
