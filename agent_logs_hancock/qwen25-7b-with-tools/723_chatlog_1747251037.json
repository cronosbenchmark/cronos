The surgery involved multiple components: tumor resection with confirmed R0 margins (no residual tumor), bilateral neck dissection (removal of lymphatic tissue from levels I-V on both sides), and defect reconstruction using a radial free flap. The left tonsillar tumor, described as a coarse, ulcerated mass, was excised along with surrounding healthy muscle tissue. The surgical margins were confirmed to be free of tumor via frozen section analysis. Neck dissections were performed bilaterally, involving en bloc resection of metastatic lymph nodes and surrounding structures, while sparing critical nerves and vessels. The radial free flap, harvested from the left forearm, was anastomosed to the superior thyroid artery and internal jugular vein, providing vascularized coverage for the defect. Additionally, a tracheostomy was performed for airway management. The procedures were completed without complications, ensuring robust vascularization of the flap and adequate defect closure.\nNew files available:\n [FILE: PrimaryTumor_HE_723.jpg]\n[FILE: PrimaryTumor_HE_723_roi.jpg]\n[FILE: LymphNode_HE_723.jpg]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD3_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD3_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD8_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD8_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD56_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD56_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD68_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD68_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD163_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD163_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_HE_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_HE_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_MHC1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_MHC1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_PDL1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_PDL1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD3_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD3_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD8_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD8_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD56_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD56_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD68_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD68_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD163_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD163_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_HE_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_HE_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_MHC1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_MHC1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_PDL1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_PDL1_1.png]\n[FILE: surgery_report.txt]\n[FILE: surgery_descriptions.txt]\n[FILE: ops_codes.json]\n[FILE: patient_pathological_data.json]\n[FILE: patient_clinical_data.json]\n[FILE: history_text.txt]\n[FILE: icd_codes.json]\n[FILE: patient_blood_data.json]\n[FILE: blood_data_reference_ranges.json]Remember that you can ask for files by providing the following tag [REQUEST: filename.extension].

You may also ask for multiple files at once if necessary. If you ask for a file, you MUST WAIT to receive it from the user.\nYou must provide a separate [REQUEST] tag for each file you need. Example [REQUEST: image1.jpg] [REQUEST: image2.jpg].\nYou can also use the CONCH model to determine cancer type or invasion by providing the H&E image name and extension and a list of options. Example: [CONCH: image1.jpg, (melanoma), (squamous cell carcinoma)] [CONCH: image2.jpg, (option 1), (option 2)].\nThe model will then tell you which option resembles the image the most. You can ONLY use this model for H&E.\n"
