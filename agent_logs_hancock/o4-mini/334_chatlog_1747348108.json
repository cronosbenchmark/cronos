Marginal samples taken during the surgery were confirmed to be tumor-free on frozen section analysis. A tracheostomy was performed to prevent aspiration, considering the functional risks post-resection. The tracheostomy was completed without complications, with a proper mucocutaneous anastomosis and placement of a 9 mm tracheostomy tube. Hemostasis was achieved, and the surgical site presented with fibrotic changes likely due to prior radiotherapy.
