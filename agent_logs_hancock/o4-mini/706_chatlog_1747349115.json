The surgery involved transoral resection of the tumor with a safety margin of 1-1.5 cm, followed by additional laser resection due to microscopic tumor infiltrates in the caudal tongue base, vallecula, and hypopharyngeal regions. Achieving an R0 resection (no residual tumor) was confirmed after further marginal sampling. Bilateral neck dissection was performed, with the removal of lymph nodes from levels II through V on both sides, revealing several conspicuous lymph nodes, particularly in level II. The procedure also included a tracheostomy for airway management and placement of a transnasal feeding tube for postoperative nutrition, as PEG insertion was not feasible due to prior abdominal surgery and the presence of a Vicryl mesh. The patient was admitted to the ICU for postoperative monitoring, with a diagnosis of N2b status on the right side. Postoperative antibiotics and nutritional support are planned, with further treatment to be determined in an interdisciplinary tumor conference.\nNew files available:\n[FILE: PrimaryTumor_HE_706.jpg]\n[FILE: PrimaryTumor_HE_706_roi.jpg]\n[FILE: LymphNode_HE_706.jpg]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD3_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD3_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD8_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD8_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD56_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD56_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD68_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD68_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD163_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD163_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_HE_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_HE_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_MHC1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_MHC1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_PDL1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_PDL1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD3_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD3_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD8_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD8_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD56_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD56_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD68_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD68_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD163_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD163_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_HE_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_HE_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_MHC1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_MHC1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_PDL1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_PDL1_1.png]\n[FILE: surgery_report.txt]\n[FILE: surgery_descriptions.txt]\n[FILE: ops_codes.json]\n[FILE: patient_pathological_data.json]\n[FILE: patient_clinical_data.json]\n[FILE: history_text.txt]\n[FILE: icd_codes.json]\n[FILE: patient_blood_data.json]\n[FILE: blood_data_reference_ranges.json]Remember that you can ask for files by providing the following tag [REQUEST: filename.extension].
