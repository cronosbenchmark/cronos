The tumor was resected with clear margins (R0 resection), as confirmed by frozen section histology. However, metastatic lymph nodes were identified intraoperatively in region II on both sides of the neck, with a large metastasis on the left and a smaller one on the right. The defect was reconstructed using a free radial forearm flap, which demonstrated excellent perfusion following microvascular anastomosis.
