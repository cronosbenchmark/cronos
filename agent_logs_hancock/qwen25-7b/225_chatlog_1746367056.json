Consequently, an additional resection was performed to ensure adequate clearance for final histological evaluation. A tracheotomy was also performed due to the surgical wound area and anatomical challenges, including a short neck and limited neck extension. This involved creating a visor tracheotomy with a mucocutaneous anastomosis and the placement of an 8 mm tracheal cannula. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring.
