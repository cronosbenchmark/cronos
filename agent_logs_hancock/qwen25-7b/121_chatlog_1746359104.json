The surgery involved transoral tumor resection achieving R0 resection (complete resection with negative margins as confirmed by frozen section analysis), neck dissection on both sides, and defect reconstruction using a microvascular anastomosed radial forearm free flap. A subtotal resection of the soft palate and portions of the tongue, posterior floor of the mouth, and submandibular gland were performed. A tracheotomy was also created to secure the airway, and a PEG tube was inserted for nutritional support. Postoperatively, the patient has a vital, well-perfused graft with no immediate complications.
