Additionally, there is high PDL1 expression, which suggests an immunosuppressive microenvironment where PD-L1 expressed by tumor cells can inhibit T-cell activation and proliferation.\n\n- **High CD3+ and CD8+ T cells**: The images also show a significant presence of CD3+ and CD8+ T-cells, indicating a pro-inflammatory microenvironment. These cells are known to play a role in immune surveillance and can help in clearing cancer cells.\n\n- **Low CD56+ lymphocytes**: The images show low CD56+ lymphocyte presence, which suggests a potential immune-evasive microenvironment. NK cells, which are CD56+ lymphocytes, are important for recognizing and killing cancer cells, so their absence may indicate a lack of immune surveillance.\n\n- **MHC1 expression**: The images show high MHC1 expression, which indicates enhanced immune recognition at the TumorCenter. MHC1 is responsible for presenting antigens to T-cells, so its presence suggests that the immune system is actively trying to recognize and respond to the tumor cells.\n\nIn summary, the tumor microenvironment at the TumorCenter is characterized by a mix of pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive factors.

Panendoscopy revealed no evidence of malignancy in the endolarynx, piriform sinus, esophagus, or oral cavity.
