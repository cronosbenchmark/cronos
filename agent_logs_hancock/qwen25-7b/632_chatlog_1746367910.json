The surgery included a transnasal intubation, followed by tumor resection with margins of 1-1.5 cm, achieving an R0 resection (no residual tumor). Additional areas with carcinoma in situ were resected, including the pterygoid process, which was chiseled down to the bone. A bilateral neck dissection was performed, with challenging conditions due to scarring from previous surgeries. Enlarged and suspicious lymph nodes in level Ia and Ib on the left side were removed. \n\nDefect reconstruction involved harvesting a radial artery free flap, which was sutured into the oral cavity to restore the anatomical defect. This process was complicated by restricted mouth opening, necessitating transcervical suturing. A tracheotomy was performed to secure the airway, and the patient was intubated with a 9-gauge tracheostomy tube. Postoperatively, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit, with antibiotics planned for 24 hours. The surgical team achieved good vascularization of the flap and no venous congestion.
