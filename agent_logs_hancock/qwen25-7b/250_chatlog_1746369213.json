The surgery involved transoral resection of the tumor with wide margins, including areas of the soft palate, anterior palatal arch, retromolar region, base of the tongue, and surrounding structures. The resection was extended to achieve an R0 resection (tumor-free margins), as confirmed by frozen section analysis. Bilateral neck dissections were performed, including a modified radical neck dissection on the left (levels Ib\u2013V) and selective neck dissection on the right (levels II\u2013IV), with removal of metastatic lymph nodes. A tracheotomy was also performed for airway management.  \n\nDefect reconstruction involved the use of a microvascular radial forearm free flap harvested from the right arm and transferred to the oral cavity and oropharyngeal defect. The vascular pedicle was successfully anastomosed to the superior thyroid artery and the facial vein using microsurgical techniques, ensuring strong arterial flow and venous return. The donor site on the forearm was reconstructed with a full-thickness skin graft from the left groin. The surgery was completed without complications, and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring. Multimodal management, including antibiotics (Unacid) and anticoagulation therapy (Heparin), was initiated. Postoperative care includes regular monitoring of the vascular pedicle, feeding through a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube for 10 days, and gradual dietary progression.\nNew files available:\n[FILE: PrimaryTumor_HE_250.jpg]\n[FILE: PrimaryTumor_HE_250_roi.jpg]\n[FILE: LymphNode_HE_250.jpg]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD3_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD3_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD8_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD8_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD56_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD56_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD68_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD68_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD163_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD163_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_HE_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_HE_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_MHC1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_MHC1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_PDL1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_PDL1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD3_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD3_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD8_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD8_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD56_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD56_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD68_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD68_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD163_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD163_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_HE_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_HE_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_MHC1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_MHC1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_PDL1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_PDL1_1.png]\n[FILE: surgery_report.txt]\n[FILE: surgery_descriptions.txt]\n[FILE: ops_codes.json]\n[FILE: patient_pathological_data.json]\n[FILE: patient_clinical_data.json]\n[FILE: history_text.txt]\n[FILE: icd_codes.json]\n[FILE: patient_blood_data.json]\n[FILE: blood_data_reference_ranges.json]Remember that you can ask for files by providing the following tag [REQUEST: filename.extension].
