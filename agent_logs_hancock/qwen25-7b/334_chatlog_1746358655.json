The specimens were confirmed to be tumor-free on frozen section analysis, which is a positive sign. However, the patient had bilateral removal of the epiglottis due to tumor infiltration, which suggests that the tumor was advanced and involved critical structures. The presence of fibrotic changes in the surgical site due to prior radiotherapy indicates that the patient may have undergone previous treatment, which can affect the outcome.\n\nGiven the complexity of the case and the need for a comprehensive assessment of the patient's condition, it is not possible to definitively predict the likelihood of recurrence based solely on the provided information. A multidisciplinary team, including oncologists, surgeons, and radiation therapists, would need to review all the available data and conduct a thorough evaluation to provide a more accurate prediction.\n\nSince the question asks for a binary answer (Yes or No), and without additional specific data on the stage of the disease, the patient's overall health, and the effectiveness of the treatment, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer. Therefore, the most appropriate response is:\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]\n\nThis answer reflects the need for a comprehensive evaluation by a medical team to provide a more accurate prediction of recurrence."
