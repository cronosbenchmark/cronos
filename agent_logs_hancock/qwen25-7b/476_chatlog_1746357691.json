A mass in this region was excised using a helium laser, maintaining a 1 cm margin around the lesion. The excised specimen was marked and analyzed via frozen section, confirming the presence of invasive squamous cell carcinoma with clear margins (resected in sano). Additional hardened mucosal tissue, which appeared non-suspicious, was also resected for final histological evaluation. No active bleeding or deeper erosion was observed during the procedure, and no significant abnormalities were noted in other inspected areas, including the esophagus, vallecula, epiglottis, or vocal folds.
