The images do not show significant lymphovascular invasion or extensive vascularization, and there is no evidence of high-grade tumor characteristics. Additionally, the patient's history does not suggest a strong association with HPV, and while tumor necrosis can reduce immune accessibility, the images do not show extensive necrosis.

During the tumor resection at the left edge of the tongue, the initial frozen section revealed carcinoma at the posterior and medial margin. A second resection was performed in this area, and the subsequent frozen section confirmed an R0 resection (complete tumor removal with negative margins). Additional attention was given to a fistula at the upper lateral edge of the tracheostoma, which was treated with curettage, biopsy, and the application of granulation-promoting dressing material.
