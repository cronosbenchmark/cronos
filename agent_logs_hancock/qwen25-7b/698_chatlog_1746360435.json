During the laser resection, the tumor was excised with CO2 laser, including a suspicious mucosal area approximately 1 cm from the main tumor. Margins were resected further due to findings of moderate dysplasia medially and narrow margins basally. Final histology will confirm whether the resection was sufficient. Additionally, a neck dissection was performed on the right side to remove lymph nodes at levels II to IV while preserving critical structures such as the carotid arteries, vagus nerve, and accessory nerve. The PEG was inserted for nutritional support and subsequently loosened postoperatively. The surgery was completed without complications, and antibiotics were prescribed for one week.
