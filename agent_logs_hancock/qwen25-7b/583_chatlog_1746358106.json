The tumor infiltrated multiple structures, including the hypoglossal nerve, sternocleidomastoid muscle, and cervical soft tissues, necessitating their resection. Marginal samples were taken from various areas, all of which were confirmed tumor-free, achieving an R0 resection (complete tumor removal with negative margins). The defect was reconstructed using a vascularized anterolateral thigh flap, with successful arterial and venous anastomoses. Postoperative care involves intensive monitoring, regular Doppler checks for flap perfusion, feeding via PEG for at least 10 days, and continuation of antibiotics (Unacid) and anticoagulation therapy (Heparin).
