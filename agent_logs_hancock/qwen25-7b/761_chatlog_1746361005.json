Again, without specific images showing vascular invasion, we cannot definitively say if there is a correlation.\n3. **CD56+ NK cells**: These are natural killer cells and can be involved in anti-tumor responses. Without specific images showing vascular invasion, we cannot definitively say if there is a correlation.\n4. **MHC1+ expression**: This is related to antigen presentation and can be involved in immune recognition. Without specific images showing vascular invasion, we cannot definitively say if there is a correlation.\n5. **PDL1+ expression**: This is related to immune checkpoint inhibition and can be involved in immune evasion. Without specific images showing vascular invasion, we cannot definitively say if there is a correlation.\n\nSince we do not have images showing vascular invasion, we cannot make a definitive statement about the correlation between vascular invasion and immune cell infiltration.

        "content": "You are given the following new patient information: \nThe patient underwent an extensive and complex surgical procedure for a hypopharyngeal carcinoma, which was larger and more invasive than initially expected, corresponding to a cT2 growth pattern. The surgery involved multiple steps, including a tracheostomy, PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) placement, radical neck dissection on both sides, partial laryngeal resection, and transcervical tumor resection with a radial free flap for defect coverage. The tumor was resected with clear margins (R0 resection) confirmed by frozen section analysis. The lymph node dissection revealed several metastatic lymph nodes, particularly on the left side, with infiltration into the sternocleidomastoid muscle, internal jugular vein, and accessory nerve, necessitating their resection. A radial free flap was harvested and used to reconstruct the pharyngeal defect, including the esophageal entrance and tongue base. Postoperative care includes daily flap monitoring and continuation of antibiotics for at least three days. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for postoperative management.\nNew files available:\n[FILE: PrimaryTumor_HE_761.jpg]\n[FILE: PrimaryTumor_HE_761_roi.jpg]\n[FILE: LymphNode_HE_761.jpg]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD3_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD3_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD8_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD8_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD56_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD56_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD68_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD68_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD163_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_CD163_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_HE_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_HE_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_MHC1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_MHC1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_PDL1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_TumorCenter_PDL1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD3_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD3_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD8_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD8_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD56_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD56_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD68_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD68_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD163_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_CD163_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_HE_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_HE_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_MHC1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_MHC1_1.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_PDL1_0.png]\n[FILE: TMA_IHC_InvasionFront_PDL1_1.png]\n[FILE: surgery_report.txt]\n[FILE: surgery_descriptions.txt]\n[FILE: ops_codes.json]\n[FILE: patient_pathological_data.json]\n[FILE: patient_clinical_data.json]\n[FILE: history_text.txt]\n[FILE: icd_codes.json]\n[FILE: patient_blood_data.json]\n[FILE: blood_data_reference_ranges.json]Remember that you can ask for files by providing the following tag [REQUEST: filename.extension].
