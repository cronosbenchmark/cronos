It was originally investigated for its antiviral effects, but it is now used as an anticancer therapy for various cancers.[A233135] Gemcitabine is a cytidine analog with two fluorine atoms replacing the hydroxyl on the ribose.[A233145] As a prodrug, gemcitabine is transformed into its active metabolites that work by replacing the building blocks of nucleic acids during DNA elongation, arresting tumour growth and promoting apoptosis of malignant cells.[L32960] The structure, metabolism, and mechanism of action of gemcitabine are similar to [cytarabine], but gemcitabine has a wider spectrum of antitumour activity.[A233140]\r\n\r\nGemcitabine is marketed as Gemzar and it is available as intravenous injection. It is approved by the FDA to treat advanced ovarian cancer in combination with [carboplatin], metastatic breast cancer in combination with [paclitaxel], non-small cell lung cancer in combination with [cisplatin], and pancreatic cancer as monotherapy.[L32950] It is also being investigated in other cancer and tumour types.\nOxaliplatin: Oxaliplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nCapecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers. Capecitabine is a prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to fluorouracil (antimetabolite) in the tumor, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor tissue.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0028198-T01-IM6\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0028198\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Pancreatic Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Pancreas\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT468\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 662, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 20.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"PAAD\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

METHODS: Patients who underwent resection for pancreatic cancer between January 2003 and December 2016 were identified from a prospective database. We analyzed the association between clinicopathological information or survival outcomes and initial recurrence patterns. RESULTS: The most frequent recurrence pattern was locoregional recurrence (n = 84, 31.3%), followed by simultaneous multiple recurrences (n = 65, 24.2%), liver metastasis (n = 53, 19.8%), peritoneal dissemination (n = 41, 15.3%), and lung metastasis (n = 20, 7.5%). In addition, survival outcomes were significantly longer in the lung metastasis group than in the other recurrence pattern group (recurrence-free survival, 18.2 vs 8.2 months, P < 0.001; overall survival, 86.4 vs 21.0 months, P < 0.001; and survival after recurrence, 37.1 vs 9.3 months, P < 0.001). The lung metastasis group had a significantly higher proportion of pancreatic body and tail cancer (P < 0.002) and arterial invasion (P = 0.006) than the other recurrence pattern group. CONCLUSIONS: Lung metastasis as an initial recurrence pattern frequently occurred in patients with body and tail cancer and patients with arterial invasion.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 33981756\nTitle: Recurrence of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma after Complete Histopathological Remission Caused by FOLFIRINOX.\nAuthors: Hohn P, Braumann C, Nopel-Dunnebacke S\nJournal: Visceral medicine\nPublication Date: 2021 Mar\nAbstract: We previously reported 2 cases of pathologic complete response (pCR) of a pancreatic cancer (PC) following neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX treatment. We now complete our report by a follow-up on both patients. Patient 1 achieved a disease-free survival of 12 months after initial resection until she developed a singular hepatic metastasis. Treatment by FOLFIRINOX and complete removal of the metastasis by atypical liver resection after 6 months allowed for another 12 months of disease control. After intra-abdominal tumor recurrence and development of intracerebral metastases, the patient died 34 months after primary diagnosis. Patient 2 developed hepatic tumor recurrence only 3 months after initial resection. However, treatment by FOLFIRINOX led to a stable disease for 27 months after resection and was followed by atypical liver resection of multiple segments. Six months later, another hepatic recurrence was suspected. Via next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the tumor genome, a deleterious mutation in the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) gene, causing a BRCAness, was detected. After initial treatment by FOLFOX, maintenance therapy with the poly-ADP-ribose-polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib was initiated. The patient is now alive for 54 months after initial diagnosis of metastasized pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Tumor recurrence is possible even after pCR of PC and remains challenging. In case of multifocal tumor recurrence, chemotherapy remains the standard treatment. Recently, genetic sequencing allows individualized treatments. In selected cases, highly specialized teams can offer a variety of therapeutic options leading to previously unseen clinical courses.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 28065427\nTitle: Systematic review on the treatment of isolated local recurrence of pancreatic cancer after surgery; re-resection, chemoradiotherapy and SBRT.\nAuthors: Groot VP, van Santvoort HC, Rombouts SJ\nJournal: HPB : the official journal of the International Hepato Pancreato Biliary Association\nPublication Date: 2017 Feb\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: The majority of patients who have undergone a pancreatic resection for pancreatic cancer develop disease recurrence within two years. In around 30% of these patients, isolated local recurrence (ILR) is found. The aim of this study was to systematically review treatment options for this subgroup of patients. METHODS: A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library. Studies reporting on the treatment of ILR after initial curative-intent resection of primary pancreatic cancer were included. Primary endpoints were morbidity, mortality and survival after ILR treatment. RESULTS: After screening 1152 studies, 18 studies reporting on 313 patients undergoing treatment for ILR were included. Treatment options for ILR included surgical re-resection (8 studies, 100 patients), chemoradiotherapy (7 studies, 153 patients) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) (4 studies, 60 patients). Morbidity and mortality were reported for re-resection (29% and 1%, respectively), chemoradiotherapy (54% and 0%) and SBRT (3% and 1%). Most patients had a prolonged disease-free interval before recurrence. Median survival after treatment of ILR of up to 32, 19 and 16 months was reported for re-resection, chemoradiotherapy and SBRT, respectively. CONCLUSION: In selected patients, treatment of ILR following pancreatic resection for pancreatic cancer seems safe, feasible and associated with relatively good survival.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

It was originally investigated for its antiviral effects, but it is now used as an anticancer therapy for various cancers.[A233135] Gemcitabine is a cytidine analog with two fluorine atoms replacing the hydroxyl on the ribose.[A233145] As a prodrug, gemcitabine is transformed into its active metabolites that work by replacing the building blocks of nucleic acids during DNA elongation, arresting tumour growth and promoting apoptosis of malignant cells.[L32960] The structure, metabolism, and mechanism of action of gemcitabine are similar to [cytarabine], but gemcitabine has a wider spectrum of antitumour activity.[A233140]\r\n\r\nGemcitabine is marketed as Gemzar and it is available as intravenous injection. It is approved by the FDA to treat advanced ovarian cancer in combination with [carboplatin], metastatic breast cancer in combination with [paclitaxel], non-small cell lung cancer in combination with [cisplatin], and pancreatic cancer as monotherapy.[L32950] It is also being investigated in other cancer and tumour types.\nOxaliplatin: Oxaliplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nCapecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers. Capecitabine is a prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to fluorouracil (antimetabolite) in the tumor, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor tissue.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: timeline1.txt] included in your context\nAGE: 74.855, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 74.855, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 74.858, diagnosis > performance_status --> ECOG: 0, \nAGE: 74.858, diagnosis > performance_status --> ECOG: 1, \nAGE: 74.948, surgery --> SUBTYPE: PROCEDURE, \nAGE: 75.184, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 75.184, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 75.184, labtest > ca_19-9_labs --> RESULT: 37, LR_UNIT_MEASURE: Units/ml, \nAGE: 75.184, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 1.6000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 75.192, diagnosis > performance_status --> ECOG: 1, \nAGE: 75.192, diagnosis > performance_status --> ECOG: 0, \nAGE: 75.683, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 75.683, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 75.683, labtest > ca_19-9_labs --> RESULT: 40, LR_UNIT_MEASURE: Units/ml, \nAGE: 75.683, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 1.3000 ng/ml          \n\n[DrugBank: Veal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0028198-T01-IM6\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0028198\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Pancreatic Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Pancreas\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT468\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 662, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 20.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"PAAD\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

BACKGROUND: Circulating tumor cells have been proposed as biomarkers to predict survival in pancreatic cancer. Some patients demonstrate persistent CTCs postoperatively, which could represent minimal residual disease. METHODS: Patients from previously published prospective circulating tumor cell in pancreatic cancer trial without clinical evidence of recurrence 12 months postoperatively and CTC testing performed 9 to 15 months postoperatively were included. The presence of epithelial and transitional CTCs (trCTCs) was evaluated as predictor of recurrence. Kaplan-Meier curve, log-rank test, and Cox model were used for survival analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-three of 129 eligible patients (circulating tumor cell in pancreatic cancer trial) were included. The trCTC-positive and negative patients were well balanced in clinicopathologic features. Patients with trCTCs had a recurrence rate per-person-month of 10.3% compared with 3.1% in trCTCs-negative patients with a median time to recurrence of 3.9 versus 27.1 months, respectively. On multivariable analysis, trCTCs positivity was associated with higher risk of late recurrence (hazard ratio: 4.7, 95% CI, 1.2-18.3, P =0.024). Fourteen (42.4%) patients recurred during the second postoperative year. One-year postoperative trCTCs positivity was associated with a higher rate of recurrence during the second year (odds ratio:13.1, 95% CI, 1.6-1953.4, P =0.028, area under curve=0.72). Integrating clinicopathologic features with trCTCs increased the area under curve to 0.80. A majority of trCTCs-positive patients (N=5, 62.5%) had multisite recurrence, followed by local-only (N=2, 25.0%) and liver-only (N=1, 12.5%) recurrence. This was in striking contrast to trCTCs-negative patients, where a majority (N=6, 66.7%) had a local-only recurrence, followed by liver-only (N=2, 22.2%) and multisite (N=1, 11.1%) recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: In patients deemed to be clinically disease-free 12 months postoperatively, trCTCs positivity is associated with higher rates of subsequent recurrence with distinct patterns of recurrence. CTCs could be used a putative biomarker to guide patient prognostication and management in pancreatic cancer.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 21327822\nTitle: Recurrence pattern and prognosis of pancreatic cancer after pancreatic fistula.\nAuthors: Nagai S, Fujii T, Kodera Y\nJournal: Annals of surgical oncology\nPublication Date: 2011 Aug\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: The negative impact of anastomotic leakage on cancer-specific survival and recurrence patterns has been recognized in colorectal cancer. In pancreatic cancer, pancreatic fistula (PF) is a serious morbidity, but its negative effect on long-term outcome remains to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of PF on pancreatic cancer recurrence. METHODS: The medical records of 184 patients with curative pancreatectomy for pancreatic cancer were reviewed. PF was scored on the basis of the International Study Group of Pancreatic Fistula classification. Overall and disease-free survivals and recurrence patterns were analyzed. Grade A PF was excluded because the negative effects can be negligible. RESULTS: PF occurred in 51 of the 184 patients (27.7%). The mortality related to PF was 0.5% (1 of 184). PF was an independent risk factor for peritoneal recurrence (hazard ratio 3.974; 95% confidence interval 1.345-11.737; P = 0.013). According to the analysis of disease-free survival in patients with peritoneal recurrence, time to recurrence was shorter and the survival rate was worse in patients with PF than in those without PF (5.6 vs. 8.2 months; 6-month survival, 40 vs. 71%; 1-year survival, 7 vs. 19%; P = 0.053). PF was an independent prognostic factor after multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 3.257; 95% confidence interval 1.201-8.828; P = 0.020). CONCLUSIONS: PF was statistically significantly related to peritoneal recurrence, and patients with PF developed peritoneal recurrence earlier than those without PF. With regard to the development of peritoneal recurrence, PF may be considered to be a negative prognostic factor.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 29770847\nTitle: The investigation of the survival time after recurrence in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma for individualization of adjuvant chemotherapy.\nAuthors: Yamada D, Eguchi H, Iwagami Y\nJournal: Surgery today\nPublication Date: 2018 Oct\nAbstract: PURPOSE: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal disease; however, the frequency of recurrence can be reduced if curative surgery following adjuvant chemotherapy is applied. At present, adjuvant chemotherapy is uniformly performed in all patients, as it is unclear which tumor types are controlled best or worst. We investigated patients with recurrence to establish the optimum treatment strategy. METHODS: Of 138 patients who underwent curative surgery for PDAC, 85 developed recurrence. Comprehensive clinicopathological factors were investigated for their association with the survival time after recurrence (SAR). RESULTS: The median SAR was 12.6 months. Treatments for recurrence included best supportive care, GEM-based therapy and S-1. The performance status [hazard ratio (HR) 0.12, P < 0.001], histological invasion of lymph vessels (HR 0.27, P < 0.001), kind of treatment for recurrence (HR 5.0, P < 0.001) and initial recurrence site (HR 2.9, P < 0.001) were independent significant risk factors for the SAR. The initial recurrence sites were the liver (n = 21, median SAR 8.8 months), lung (n = 10, 14.9 months), peritoneum (n = 6, 1.7 months), lymph nodes (n = 6, 14.7 months), local site (n = 17, 13.9 months) and multiple sites (n = 25, 10.1 months). A shorter recurrence-free survival (< 1 year) and higher postoperative CA19-9 level were significantly associated with critical recurrence (peritoneal/liver). CONCLUSIONS: Several risk factors for SAR were detected in this study. Further investigations are needed to individualize the adjuvant chemotherapy for each patient with PDAC.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

        "content": "The PubMed search results provide valuable context regarding recurrence risk after one year of disease-free survival in pancreatic cancer. Here's a breakdown of the key findings:\n\n*   **Persistent CTCs:** Article #1 demonstrates that persistent circulating tumor cells (CTCs) one year after resection are associated with a significantly higher risk of late recurrence and a distinct pattern of recurrence (more often multisite). This suggests that CTC positivity could identify patients at higher risk.\n*   **Pancreatic Fistula:** Article #2 highlights that pancreatic fistula (PF) after surgery is linked to an increased risk of peritoneal recurrence, which is associated with worse outcomes. While not directly related to recurrence *after* one year of disease-free survival, it's a relevant factor in the patient's overall history.\n*   **Survival After Recurrence:** Article #3 investigates factors influencing survival *after* recurrence, finding that performance status, lymphovascular invasion, treatment for recurrence, and initial recurrence site are significant predictors. It also notes that recurrence-free survival < 1 year and higher CA19-9 levels are associated with more aggressive recurrence patterns.\n\nConsidering these findings, and the fact that the patient has remained disease-free for a full year with stable tumor markers and no evidence of recurrence on imaging, the risk of recurrence in the next 12 months is lower than initially assessed. However, the presence of persistent CTCs (which we don't have data on for this patient) could elevate that risk.\n\nGiven the available information, and acknowledging the inherent risk of recurrence in pancreatic cancer, I am revising my assessment.

It was originally investigated for its antiviral effects, but it is now used as an anticancer therapy for various cancers.[A233135] Gemcitabine is a cytidine analog with two fluorine atoms replacing the hydroxyl on the ribose.[A233145] As a prodrug, gemcitabine is transformed into its active metabolites that work by replacing the building blocks of nucleic acids during DNA elongation, arresting tumour growth and promoting apoptosis of malignant cells.[L32960] The structure, metabolism, and mechanism of action of gemcitabine are similar to [cytarabine], but gemcitabine has a wider spectrum of antitumour activity.[A233140]\r\n\r\nGemcitabine is marketed as Gemzar and it is available as intravenous injection. It is approved by the FDA to treat advanced ovarian cancer in combination with [carboplatin], metastatic breast cancer in combination with [paclitaxel], non-small cell lung cancer in combination with [cisplatin], and pancreatic cancer as monotherapy.[L32950] It is also being investigated in other cancer and tumour types.\nOxaliplatin: Oxaliplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nCapecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers. Capecitabine is a prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to fluorouracil (antimetabolite) in the tumor, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor tissue.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: timeline1.txt] included in your context\nAGE: 74.855, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 74.855, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 74.858, diagnosis > performance_status --> ECOG: 0, \nAGE: 74.858, diagnosis > performance_status --> ECOG: 1, \nAGE: 74.948, surgery --> SUBTYPE: PROCEDURE, \nAGE: 75.184, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 75.184, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 75.184, labtest > ca_19-9_labs --> RESULT: 37, LR_UNIT_MEASURE: Units/ml, \nAGE: 75.184, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 1.6000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 75.192, diagnosis > performance_status --> ECOG: 1, \nAGE: 75.192, diagnosis > performance_status --> ECOG: 0, \nAGE: 75.683, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 75.683, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 75.683, labtest > ca_19-9_labs --> RESULT: 40, LR_UNIT_MEASURE: Units/ml, \nAGE: 75.683, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 1.3000 ng/ml          \n\n[DrugBank: Veal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0028198-T01-IM6\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0028198\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Pancreatic Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Pancreas\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT468\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 662, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 20.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"PAAD\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

Here's a summary of the key information:\n\n*   **Initial Diagnosis & Treatment:** The patient was initially diagnosed with Stage 1-3 pancreatic adenocarcinoma at age 73.5 and underwent multiple lines of chemotherapy.\n*   **Disease-Free Interval:** The patient achieved a period of disease-free survival from approximately age 74.6 to 76.0.\n*   **Recurrence:** The patient experienced a recurrence at age 76.0, with evidence of cancer in lymph nodes (abdomen, chest, pelvis).\n*   **Recent Scans (Age 76.5-76.8):** Subsequent CT scans (76.5, 76.8) show the cancer has *not* progressed since the initial recurrence detection.\n*   **Tumor Markers:** CA 19-9 levels have been stable, ranging from 47 to 55 units/ml. CEA levels remain relatively low (1.3-1.4 ng/ml).\n*   **Age:** The patient is currently 77 years old.\n\nThe PubMed search results highlight that survival after recurrence in pancreatic cancer is limited, particularly in elderly patients. However, stable disease after recurrence, even if for a short period, can be a factor in prognosis.\n\nGiven the patient's age (77), the recurrence of pancreatic cancer, and the fact that the disease has not progressed *recently* (ages 76.5-76.8), the prognosis is guarded. While the disease is currently stable, pancreatic cancer is aggressive, and the likelihood of further progression is high. Considering these factors, and the limited survival data for recurrent pancreatic cancer in elderly patients, I believe the probability of the patient being alive in the next 12 months is low.\n\n[ANSWER: B]"
