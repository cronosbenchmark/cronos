It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nCapecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers. Capecitabine is a prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to fluorouracil (antimetabolite) in the tumor, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor tissue.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

We determined the relative contribution of clinical and molecular features to survival by risk group. MATERIALS & METHODS: Stage III colon cancer (N = 5337) patients from two adjuvant trials of FOLFOX +/- cetuximab [N0147 (Alliance), PETACC-8] were risk grouped, then subgrouped by clinical features and molecular variables [KRAS and BRAF/mismatch repair (MMR) combined variable]. Distributions of disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), and survival after recurrence (SAR) were estimated. In multivariable Cox models, backward elimination was performed for analysis of candidate predictors of outcomes. Relative contributions of model-selected variables to outcomes by risk group were calculated using chi2. RESULTS: Among low risk tumours, mutant KRAS and male gender were significantly associated with poorer OS multivariately. In high risk tumours, significantly poorer OS was observed for right sidedness and for mutant KRAS and BRAF(V600E)/pMMR, subgroups. Specifically, BRAF(V600E)/pMMR (OS: HR = 1.75; 95% CI: 1.36-2.24; P(adj)<.0001) and right- versus left-sidedness were associated with significantly poorer DFS, OS (HR = 1.56; 95% CI: 1.31-1.83; P(adj)<.0001), and SAR (HR = 1.64; 95% CI: 1.37-1.95; P(adj)<.0001). Poor prognosis of mutant KRAS for DFS and OS was similar among risk groups. BRAF/MMR and sidedness were associated with poorer SAR in both low and high risk tumours. Age, gender, and KRAS were the top three relative contributors to DFS and OS among low risk tumours; sidedness ranked first for DFS and OS, and second to BRAF/MMR for SAR among high risk tumours. CONCLUSION: Sidedness and BRAF/MMR contributed the most to survival outcomes among high risk tumours and should be interpreted in the context of risk group.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 27573560\nTitle: Phase III trial comparing 3-6 months of adjuvant FOLFOX4/XELOX in stage II-III colon cancer: safety and compliance in the TOSCA trial.\nAuthors: Lonardi S, Sobrero A, Rosati G\nJournal: Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology\nPublication Date: 2016 Nov\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Six months of oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy is standard of care for radically resected stage III colon cancer and an accepted option for high-risk stage II. A shorter duration of therapy, if equally efficacious, would be advantageous for patients and Health-Care Systems. PATIENTS AND METHODS: TOSCA ['Randomized trial investigating the role of FOLFOX-4 or XELOX (3 versus 6 months) regimen duration and bevacizumab as adjuvant therapy for patients with stage II/III colon cancer] is an open-label, phase III, multicenter, noninferiority trial randomizing patients with high-risk stage II or stage III radically resected colon cancer to receive 3 months (arm 3 m) versus 6 months (arm 6 m) of FOLFOX4/XELOX. Primary end-point was relapse-free survival. We present here safety and compliance data. RESULTS: From June 2007 to March 2013, 3759 patients were accrued from 130 Italian sites, 64% receiving FOLFOX4 and 36% XELOX in either arm. Treatment completion rate without any modification was 35% versus 12% and with delays or dose reduction 52% versus 44% in arm 3 and 6 m. Treatment was permanently discontinued in 8% (arm 3 m) and 33% (arm 6 m). In arm 6 m, 50% of patients discontinuing treatment did so after completing 80% of planned program. Grade 3+ toxicities were higher in arm 6 m than that in 3 m. Grade 2+ neuropathy was 31.2% versus 8.8% (P < 0.0001) while grade 3+ was 8.4 versus 1.3 (P < 0.0001), in arm 3 and 6 m. Seven deaths within 30 days from last treatment administration in arm 6 m and three deaths in arm 3 m were observed (0.3% versus 0.1%, P = 0.34). CONCLUSIONS: TOSCA is the first trial comparing 3 versus 6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy completing accrual within the international initiative of treatment duration evaluation (International Duration Evaluation of Adjuvant, IDEA). High compliance to treatment in control arm will allow a correct assessment of potential differences between the two treatment durations.

Frequently, adjuvant chemotherapy is unable to prevent tumor recurrence. Thus, novel therapeutic strategies are warranted. The aim of this study was to establish a model of human colon cancer metastatic to the liver of nude mice, to assess, in this setting, the therapeutic efficacy of radioimmunotherapy (RAIT) compared to standard chemotherapy and to evaluate, in a Phase I/II trial, the toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of RAIT in colorectal cancer patients with small volume disease metastatic to the liver. Multiple liver metastases of the human colon cancer cell line GW-39 were induced by intrasplenic injection of a 10% tumor cell suspension. Whereas controls were left untreated, therapy was initiated on day 10 or 20 after tumor inoculation with the 131I-labeled, low affinity anticarcinoembryonic antigen (anti-CEA) monoclonal antibody (MAb), F023C5 (Ka = 10(7) liters/mol), or the high-affinity anti-CEA MAb, MN-14 (Ka = 10(9) liters/mol), or chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (folinic acid) versus irinotecan) at their respective maximum tolerated doses (MTDs). Twelve colorectal cancer patients with small volume disease metastatic to the liver (all lesions < or = 2.5 cm) were entered into a mCi/m2-based Phase I dose escalation study with 131I-labeled humanized version of MN-14, hMN-14. The patients were given single injections, starting at 50 mCi/m2 and escalating in 10-mCi/m2 increments. The MTD was defined as the dose level at which < or = 1 of 6 patients develop grade 4 myelotoxicity. In the mice, untreated controls died from rapidly progressing hepatic metastases at 6-8 weeks after tumor inoculation. The life span of mice treated with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin was prolonged for only 1-3 weeks, whereas irinotecan led to a 5-8-week prolongation. In contrast, at their respective MTDs, the 131I-labeled low-affinity anti-CEA MAb, F023C5, led to a 20% permanent cure rate, and the high affinity MAb, MN-14, led to an 80% permanent cure rate, when therapy was initiated at 10 days after tumor inoculation. In the 20-day-old tumor stage, although it prolonged life, 131I-F023C5 was unable to achieve cures, whereas 131I-MN-14 was still successful in 20%. Histologically, no remaining viable tumor cells could be demonstrated in these animals surviving > 6 months. In patients, the MTD was reached at 60 mCi/m2 of hMN-14 (at 70 mCi/m2, two of three grade 4 myelotoxicities). Of 11 assessable patients, 2 had partial remissions (corresponding to an objective response rate of 18%), and 5 (45%) had minor/mixed responses or experienced stabilization of previously rapidly progressing disease. These data suggest that in small volume disease, RAIT may be superior to conventional chemotherapy. Antibodies of higher affinity seem to be clearly superior. The clinical response rates in patients with small volume disease are encouraging, being comparable to the response rates of conventional chemotherapeutic regimens but with fewer side effects. Ongoing studies will show whether treatment at the MTD will further improve therapeutic results.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

The 5-year disease-free survival rate was 75\u00b72% (95% CI 73\u00b74\u201377\u00b70) and the 10-year disease-free survival rate was 64\u00b78% (95% CI 62\u00b76\u201367\u00b70). The 5-year overall survival rate was 83\u00b74% (95% CI 81\u00b76\u201385\u00b72) and the 10-year overall survival rate was 72\u00b72% (95% CI 69\u00b78\u201374\u00b76).

Our aim was to investigate the benefit of adjuvant treatment for younger (<70 years) and elderly (>/=70 years) patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The long-term outcome of patients (n=855) enrolled in a randomized controlled trial comparing adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-FU alone, 5-FU plus folinic acid (FA), and 5-FU plus interferon-alpha (IFNa) was compared in younger (<70 years) and elderly (>/=70 years) patients using a quotient of each patient's survival time and his expected residual life expectancy (QSL) and a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Eight-year overall survival (OS) rates were 58.3% and 57.4% for younger (n=653) and elderly (n=202) patients, respectively. In elderly patients, 8-year OS rates were 51.4%, 61.8%, and 56.3, and median QSL scores were 0.338, 0.371, and 0.343 for 5-FU (n=59), 5-FU plus FA (n=76), and 5-FU plus IFNa (n=67), respectively. In elderly patients treatment with 5-FU plus FA decreased the risk for an event by 1.5-fold compared to 5-FU (HR=0.657, 95%CI=0.495-0.870, p=0.004) and 5-FU plus INFa (HR=0.685, 95%CI=0.515-0.912, p=0.009). CONCLUSION: Our analysis clearly demonstrates for the first time an additional benefit of FA for adjuvant treatment of elderly CC patients. We conclude that this regimen is very safe and effective for adjuvant treatment of elderly patients.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 9514423\nTitle: Curative surgery for colorectal cancer: long-term results and life expectancy in the elderly.\nAuthors: Violi V, Pietra N, Grattarola M\nJournal: Diseases of the colon and rectum\nPublication Date: 1998 Mar\nAbstract: PURPOSE: The long-term prognosis after curative surgery for colorectal cancer was evaluated in relation to age and life expectancy as a possible basis for assessing the risk to benefit ratios in the elderly. METHODS: Data relating to 1,256 patients operated on from 1976 to 1994 were stored in a computer database prospectively from 1987. Patients were subdivided into four age groups (A = <60 years; B = 60-69; C = 70-79; D = > or =80). Distribution of general contraindications to curative surgery was examined. In the 869 patients who underwent curative treatment (A = 206; B = 256; C = 289; D = 118), distribution of tumor stage and elective/emergency surgery and the operative mortality rate were evaluated. Crude and age-corrected survival curves were calculated in 794 patients. The median crude survival of each group was related by gender and tumor stage to demographic life expectancy, assuming as \"relative median survival index\" the ratio between the two values. RESULTS: General contraindications to curative surgery increased significantly with age. The operative mortality rate was higher in Group D than in Groups A, B, plus C over the total series (P < 0.001) and in both elective (P < 0.001) and emergency surgery (P < 0.05). Intergroup analysis of long-term survival rates showed significant differences between \"crude\" (P = 0.0057) but not age-corrected (P = 0.66) curves. The relative median survival index increased with age, up to approximately 1 in the local stages of Groups C and D. CONCLUSIONS: To evaluate long-term results, elderly patients should be compared with unaffected, same-age subjects. Because the risks may be very high, the surgical policy in the elderly should be carefully weighed and related to life expectancy and actual results.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 38110533\nTitle: Colorectal cancer surgery in octogenarians: real-world long-term results.\nAuthors: Willemsen P, Devriendt S, Heyman S\nJournal: Langenbeck's archives of surgery\nPublication Date: 2023 Dec 18\nAbstract: AIMS: Colon cancer is the most common intra-abdominal cancer in older people. In the elderly with cancer, clinical decision making is often complicated by the effects of aging. However, as life expectancy continues to rise, more people aged 80 and older will present with colorectal cancer and may need major surgery. METHODS: Between 2000 and 2020 we operated on 352 patients aged 80 and older for colorectal cancer. We reviewed the case-notes of these patients and made a survival analysis for those patients who had a surgical resection of the tumor. RESULTS: In 20 patients a palliative procedure was performed. Three hundred and thirty-two (332) patients had a colorectal cancer resected. Of these, 57 patients died within 90 days postoperatively. Survival analysis was done for 275 patients who were alive longer than 90 days postoperatively. The overall 5-year survival in this group is 41.5%. There was no significant difference in postoperative survival between patients over the age of 85 and patients aged 80-84 at the time of operation. The survival of patients with stage IV colorectal adenocarcinoma is significantly worse than survival in stage I-III patients (Cox-Mantel log-rank test p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: After exclusion of the patients in the 90-day mortality group the overall 5-year survival in octogenarians who had a resection of a colorectal cancer was 41.5%. The most difficult problem is to choose the right treatment for the right patient. Optimal surgical and adjuvant treatment should not be denied to these older patients.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
