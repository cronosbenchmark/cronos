Here's a breakdown of the patient's case and my assessment of the risk of recurrence:\n\n**Key Findings from Timeline0.txt:**\n\n*   **Diagnosis:** Lung Adenocarcinoma (Stage 1-3, Clinical Group 2B, Pathological Group 3A) with regional lymph node involvement.\n*   **Treatment:** The patient received chemotherapy with pemetrexed and carboplatin (stopped at age 79.0636) and radiation therapy.\n*   **Response to Treatment:** A CT scan at age 79.129 showed no evidence of progression.\n*   **Performance Status:** ECOG performance status fluctuated between 0 and 1 during the observed period.\n*   **MSI Status:** Microsatellite Stable (MSS).\n\n**Key Findings from specimen.txt:**\n\n*   Confirms Lung Adenocarcinoma diagnosis.\n*   TMB (Tumor Mutational Burden) is 2.59, which is relatively low.\n*   MSI status is stable.\n\n**Analysis and Risk Assessment:**\n\nThe patient received standard treatment (chemotherapy and radiation) for lung adenocarcinoma. The CT scan showing no progression is a positive sign. However, the initial stage (1-3) and lymph node involvement indicate a risk of recurrence. The MSS status and relatively low TMB suggest the patient is less likely to respond to immunotherapy, which is sometimes used for recurrence.\n\nGiven the patient's age (79.3 years), the relatively short observation period in the timeline (78.7 to 79.3 years), and the fact that the last scan showed no progression, it's difficult to definitively predict recurrence within the next 12 months. However, recurrence is still possible, especially given the initial stage and lymph node involvement.\n\n[PUBMED: lung adenocarcinoma recurrence rates stage 2b elderly]\n\nBased on the available information, I lean towards a slightly increased risk of recurrence, but it is not certain.\n\n[ANSWER: A]"

So, the proportion of patients with serious comorbidity also increases [1,2]. Lung cancer treatment is characterized by a narrow therapeutic index. When life expectancy is short and therapeutic benefit is limited, it is of paramount importance to know the specific cause of death. Comorbidity is understood as a competing cause of death, and is the main exclusion criterion for lung cancer clinical trials. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of comorbidity in elderly lung cancer patients seen in an outpatient oncology department and to determine its correlation with survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 2006 and February 2008, 83 untreated lung cancer patients over the age of 70 years were enrolled in the study. Comorbidity was evaluated according to the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) [3] and the simplified comorbidity score (SCS) [4]. RESULTS: 83 patients (97.6% men, mean age 77 years) were studied. Comorbidities: tobacco consumption (94.6%), cardiovascular diseases (65%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (59%). Mean CCI was 3 (range 0-9). Mean SCS was 9 (range 4-19), and 47% of patients had an SCS>9. Comorbidity was fairly well correlated with age, ADL, IADL, and stage. Neither the CCI nor the SCS was related to survival (p: 0.47 and p: 0.24, log rank, respectively). Median survival was 326 days (95% CI, 259-393 days; or 10.8 months, 95% CI 8.6-13.1 months). Main cause of death was lung cancer disease progression (69.5%, 57 patients), with 20 patients (25%) dying of other non-neoplastic causes. Stage was significantly associated with survival (log rank: p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Although there was a high prevalence of comorbidity in our population, comorbidity was not related to survival. Comorbidity is one of the main reasons for undertreatment of elderly lung cancer patients, but this study indicates that this undertreatment may not be warranted given that those comorbidities may not cause a patient's death. Our data generated more of a hypothesis than a conclusion. Comorbidity should be an impetus for treatment design instead of an exclusion criterion for oncologic treatment.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 19410305\nTitle: Safety and feasibility of radiotherapy treatment in elderly non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.\nAuthors: Fiorica F, Cartei F, Ursino S\nJournal: Archives of gerontology and geriatrics\nPublication Date: 2010 Mar-Apr\nAbstract: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and activity of radiotherapy (RT) treatment in elderly patients with locally advanced lung cancer. From January 2002 to December 2007, 51 consecutive patients (43 men and 8 women) aged > or = 65 received RT for locally advanced lung cancer, 22 with radical intent and 16 in adjuvant setting. Thirty-six patients received chemotherapy. Variables considered were age, co-morbidities, evaluated according to the adult co-morbidity evaluation index (ACE-27), surgery vs. no surgery, radiation dose and chemotherapy. The median age was 74.7 years (range 65-91). Of the patients, 15.7% had no co-morbidity, 41.2% mild, 25.5% moderate, and 17.6% had severe co-morbidities. Sixteen subjects (31.4%) underwent surgery. All patients completed the planned radiation schedule, while chemotherapy was reduced in 16 patients. At a median follow-up of 22 months, the 2- and 3-year overall survival rates were 46.5% and 35.4%, respectively. Patients with no or mild co-morbidities (p < 0.0001) and a good performance status (p < 0.0001) had a better survival. The actuarial progression-free survival at 2 and 3 years was 41.4% and 38.2%, respectively. Acute lung toxicity rates were different between patients with different ACE-27 indexes, whereas late toxicity was not influenced. In conclusion, in elderly patients, the compliance with RT is good and the rate of toxicity is acceptable. Patients with no or mild co-morbidities have a significantly better survival. The increasing severity of co-morbidities may sufficiently shorten the remaining life expectancy, cancel the gains obtained by RT and increase the acute lung toxicity. Further prospective trials are needed to confirm these results.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 15967582\nTitle: Cancer in the older person.\nAuthors: Carreca I, Balducci L, Extermann M\nJournal: Cancer treatment reviews\nPublication Date: 2005 Aug\nAbstract: Cancer in the older person is an increasingly common problem, due to the progressive prolongation of the life-expectancy of the Western population. This article reviews the mechanisms associating aging and cancer, age-related changes in cancer biology, assessment of the older person to estimate life-expectancy, treatment tolerance, and medical and social conditions that may interfere with cancer treatment, effectiveness of cancer prevention and cancer treatment in older individuals. A comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is commonly used to predict life-expectancy and functional reserve and to unearth conditions that may jeopardize cancer prevention and treatment. In the interest of cost and time, shortened forms of CGA are being explored. Chemoprevention of cancer is a promising form of prevention that at present has no conclusive clinical indications. Early diagnosis of breast and colon cancer through screening of asymptomatic patients at risk may be beneficial for individuals with a life-expectancy of 5 years or longer. Early detection of lung cancer in ex-smokers is undergoing clinical trials, as this disease is becoming more and more common. Age should not prevent appropriate treatment of cancer in older individuals, especially in those with adequate life-expectancy and functional reserve. The National Cancer Center Network (NCCN) has issued a series of guidelines to minimize the toxicity and promote the effectiveness of cancer in older patients. Important interventions include prevention of neutropaenic infections with filgrastim and peg-filgrastim, prevention of anaemia with epoietin or darbepoietin, and prevention and early management of mucositis.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

The articles highlight several important points:\n\n*   **Comorbidity is significant:** Comorbidities (other health conditions) are common in elderly cancer patients and can significantly impact survival. However, one study suggests comorbidity *may not* directly cause death, but rather influence treatment decisions.\n*   **Life Expectancy & Treatment:** Assessing life expectancy is crucial for determining appropriate treatment strategies.\n*   **Survival Rates:** The radiotherapy study showed 2- and 3-year overall survival rates of 46.5% and 35.4%, respectively, in elderly NSCLC patients. This is a broad range and depends heavily on comorbidities and performance status.\n*   **Progression as a Cause of Death:** One study found that lung cancer progression was the main cause of death in 69.5% of elderly patients.\n\nConsidering this information, along with the fact that the patient *has now demonstrated cancer progression* at age 81.395, and the patient is 81.5 years old, the prognosis is significantly worsened. While some elderly patients with progressing lung cancer can live for a considerable time, the probability of surviving another 12 months is considerably reduced.\n\nGiven the progression, the patient's age, and the general trends in survival for elderly patients with progressing lung cancer, I must revise my answer.\n\n[ANSWER: B]"

is an oral, third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) drug developed by AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals.[A7926,L43453] Its use is indicated for the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in cases where tumour EGFR expression is positive for the T790M mutation as detected by FDA-approved testing and which has progressed following therapy with a first-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Approximately 10% of patients with NSCLC have a rapid and clinically effective response to EGFR-TKIs due to the presence of specific activating EGFR mutations within the tumour cells.[A7927] More specifically, deletions around the LREA motif in exon 19 and exon 21 L858R point mutations are correlated with response to therapy.[A7928]\r\n\r\nDevelopment of third-generation EGFR-TKIs, such as osimertinib, has been in response to altered tumour resistance patterns following treatment and toxic side effects that impact patient quality of life. Treatment with first-generation EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib and erlotinib) has been associated with the development of resistance through activating mutations in the EGFR gene. Second-generation EGFR-TKIs (afatinib and dacomitinib) were then developed to be more potent inhibitors, although their use is associated with increased toxicity through nonspecific targeting of wild-type EGFR. In contrast, third-generation inhibitors are specific for the gate-keeper T790M mutations which increases ATP binding activity to EGFR and result in poor prognosis for late-stage disease. Furthermore, osimertinib has been shown to spare wild-type EGFR during therapy, thereby reducing non-specific binding and limiting toxicity.[A7926,A7927,A7931]\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: timeline0.txt] included in your context\nAGE: 78.729, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: PET, HAS_CANCER: Yes, PROCEDURE_TYPE: PET, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: Yes, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 78.729, diagnosis > progression --> PROGRESSION: N, PROCEDURE_TYPE: PET, \nAGE: 78.729, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), PET, TUMOR_SITE: Lung, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, HEAD: Yes, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 78.729, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), PET, TUMOR_SITE: Lymph Nodes, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, HEAD: Yes, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 78.784, samples > clinical_sample --> SAMPLE_ID: P-0041210-T01-IM6, PATIENT_ID: P-0041210, CANCER_TYPE: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, SAMPLE_TYPE: Primary, SAMPLE_CLASS: Tumor, METASTATIC_SITE: Not Applicable, PRIMARY_SITE: Lung, CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED: Lung Adenocarcinoma, GENE_PANEL: IMPACT468, SAMPLE_COVERAGE: 623, TUMOR_PURITY: 30.0, ONCOTREE_CODE: LUAD, MSI_COMMENT: MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

However, evidence of the outcomes of osimertinib treatment in patients over 75 years of age in the real-world setting is limited. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed the data of 538 patients (203 elderly and 335 non-elderly) with EGFR mutation-positive lung cancer in whom osimertinib was initiated as first-line treatment between August 2018 and December 2019. Patients over 75 years of age were classified as elderly. The data cut-off date was February 28, 2022. RESULTS: The progression-free survival (PFS) did not significantly differ between the elderly and non-elderly groups [elderly group: median PFS, 16.9 months (95 % confidence interval (CI), 14.3-20.2); non-elderly group: median PFS, 22.1 months (95 % CI: 19.5-26.3); hazard ratio (HR) for the elderly against the non-elderly: 1.21 (95 % CI: 0.98-1.50), p = 0.079]. However, the time to treatment failure (TTF) was significantly shorter in the elderly than in the non-elderly [elderly group: median TTF, 14.0 months (95 % CI: 0.98-1.50); non-elderly group: median TTF, 21.8 months (95 % CI: 18.2-24.6); HR for the elderly against the non-elderly: 1.46 (95 % CI: 1.20-1.77), p < 0.001]. Furthermore, the rate of treatment discontinuation because of adverse events was 28.6 % in the elderly and 14.9 % in the non-elderly (p < 0.001). Among patients who discontinued treatment, the conversion rate to second-line treatment was 39.6 % in the elderly and 72.8 % in the non-elderly. In addition, the median overall survival was 30 months (95 % CI: 25.8-37.7) in the elderly and not reached (NR) (95 % CI: NR-NR) in the non-elderly (p < 0.001).

METHODS: Herein, we report updated survival data, post-progression management, cost/effectiveness and budget impact (BI) of osimertinib compared with a RW population receiving gefitinib or erlotinib. RESULTS: Overall, 189 Caucasian patients receiving first-line osimertinib were included. After a follow-up of 20.7 months, 74(39.2%) patients discontinued osimertinib, median time-to-treatment discontinuation (mTTD) was 27.9 months, overall survival 36.8 months. At progression, tissue biopsy was performed in 29 (56.9%), liquid biopsy in 15 (29.4%) and both in 7 (13.7%) cases. The most frequent resistant mechanism was MET amplification (N = 14, 29.8%). At data cutoff, 13 (6.9%) patients were continuing osimertinib beyond progression; 52 (67.5%) received second-line treatment; no further treatments were administered in 25 (32.5%) cases. Thirty-three (63.4%) patients received chemotherapy, 12(23.1%) TKIs combination. Cost-effectiveness analysis showed a total cost per patient based on RW mTTD of 98,957.34euro, 21,726.28euro and 19,637.83euro for osimertinib, erlotinib and gefitinib, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER)/month for osimertinib was 359,806.0euro/life-year-gained (LYG) and 197,789.77euro/LYG compared to erlotinib and gefitinib. For osimertinib, the BI-gap between RW-TTD and theoretical-TTD was 16,501.0euro per patient. CONCLUSIONS: This updated analysis confirms the effectiveness of osimertinib in RW. Although the ICER of osimertinib seems not cost-effective, additional costs for the management of disease progression to old generation TKIs were not considered in this study. The BI-gap suggests RW mTTD as a more reliable measure for expense estimation.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 31825714\nTitle: Osimertinib for Patients With Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Harboring Uncommon EGFR Mutations: A Multicenter, Open-Label, Phase II Trial (KCSG-LU15-09).\nAuthors: Cho JH, Lim SH, An HJ\nJournal: Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology\nPublication Date: 2020 Feb 10\nAbstract: PURPOSE: Approximately 10% of patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harbor uncommon mutations. Here, we report the efficacy and safety of osimertinib in patients with NSCLC harboring uncommon EGFR mutations. PATIENT AND METHODS: This was a multicenter, single-arm, open-label, phase II study in Korea. Patients with histologically confirmed metastatic or recurrent NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations other than the exon 19 deletion, L858R and T790M mutations, and exon 20 insertion were eligible for the study. The primary end point of objective response rate was assessed every 6 weeks by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Secondary end points were progression-free survival, overall survival, duration of response, and safety. RESULTS: Between March 2016 and October 2017, 37 patients were enrolled. All were evaluable except one patient who withdrew consent after starting treatment. Median age was 60 years, and 22 (61%) were male. Among patients, 61% received osimertinib as first-line therapy. The mutations identified were G719X (n = 19; 53%), followed by L861Q (n = 9; 25%), S768I (n = 8; 22%), and others (n = 4; 11%). Objective response rate was 50% (18 of 36 patients; 95% CI, 33% to 67%). Median progression-free survival was 8.2 months (95% CI, 5.9 to 10.5 months), and median overall survival was not reached. Median duration of response was 11.2 months (95% CI, 7.7 to 14.7 months). Adverse events of any grade were rash (n = 11; 31%), pruritus (n = 9; 25%), decreased appetite (n = 9; 25%), diarrhea (n = 8; 22%), and dyspnea (n = 8; 22%), but all adverse events were manageable. CONCLUSION: Osimertinib demonstrated favorable activity with manageable toxicity in patients with NSCLC harboring uncommon EGFR mutations.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

        "content": "Okay, I have reviewed the PubMed search results regarding Osimertinib in elderly lung cancer patients.\n\n**Key Findings from the Articles:**\n\n*   **Real-World Data:** A retrospective study (PMID: 37992594) showed that elderly patients (over 75) receiving Osimertinib as first-line treatment had similar progression-free survival (PFS) to younger patients, but a shorter time to treatment failure (TTF) and a higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse events. Median overall survival was significantly lower in the elderly group (30 months vs. NR).\n*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** Another study (PMID: 38520745) analyzed the cost-effectiveness of Osimertinib and found it to be potentially not cost-effective, although this analysis had limitations.\n*   **Uncommon Mutations:** A phase II trial (PMID: 31825714) showed Osimertinib activity in patients with uncommon EGFR mutations, but this doesn't specifically address elderly patients.\n\n**Analysis & Revised Assessment:**\n\nThe most relevant study (PMID: 37992594) indicates that while Osimertinib can be effective in elderly patients, they are more likely to discontinue treatment due to adverse events and have a shorter overall survival.\n\nGiven the patient is 81.7 years old, has progressing disease, and has *just started* Osimertinib, the prognosis remains uncertain. The initiation of targeted therapy is a positive step, but the potential for treatment discontinuation due to side effects, as highlighted in the research, is a significant concern.\n\nConsidering the recent progression, the patient's age, and the potential challenges with Osimertinib tolerance, I still believe the probability of survival for another 12 months is reduced. However, the initiation of targeted therapy introduces a degree of uncertainty that makes a definitive prediction difficult.\n\n[ANSWER: B]"
