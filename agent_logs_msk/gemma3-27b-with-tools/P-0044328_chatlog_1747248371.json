The tumor was PD-L1 positive and MSS (Microsatellite Stable). The patient received chemotherapy with Carboplatin and Paclitaxel around age 50.  Multiple CT scans following the initial diagnosis and treatment (ages 49.877, 50.318, 51.315, and 51.841) have consistently shown *no evidence of progression*.\n\nGiven this information, the risk of recurrence in the next 12 months appears relatively low. However, it's important to remember that lung cancer, even at early stages, can recur. The PD-L1 positivity suggests potential benefit from immunotherapy if recurrence occurs.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was made of 302 patients who underwent lung resection for stage I-IIA NSCLC in our clinic between January 2014 and August 2021. RESULTS: The recurrence rate was higher in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) than in those with adenocarcinoma (AC) (p = 0.004). Disease-free survival (DFS) was shorter in SCC (p = 0.004). According to histopathological subtypes, the presence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI), vascular invasion (VI), visceral pleural invasion (VPI) and tumor spread through air spaces (STAS) caused an increased risk of recurrence ((p = 0.004), (p = 0.001), (p = 0.047), (p = < 0.001)) and shorter DFS ((p = 0.002), (p = < 0.001), (p = 0.038), (p = < 0.001)). LVI and VI was more common in patients with distant recurrence (p = 0.020, p = 0.002), while the STAS was more common with locoregional recurrence (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: The presence of LVI, VI, VPI, and STAS are negative risk factors for recurrence and DFS in all patients and in patients with AC. In patients with SCC, the diagnosis of SCC itself and the presence of STAS were risk factors for recurrence and DFS. Moreover, the risk of distant recurrence is higher in the presence of LVI or VI, and the risk of locoregional recurrence in the presence of STAS is higher.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 31584965\nTitle: Integrated evaluation of clinical, pathological and radiological prognostic factors in squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.\nAuthors: Gu K, Lee HY, Lee K\nJournal: PloS one\nPublication Date: 2019\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE: Little is known about prognostic factors for lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). We aimed to explore radiologic and clinical factors affecting prognosis and to compare the prognosis of both central and peripheral lung SCCs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radiologic, clinical, and pathologic profiles of surgically confirmed SCCs from 382 patients were retrospectively reviewed. Tumor location, enhancement, necrosis, the presence of obstructive pneumonitis/atelectasis and underlying lung disease were evaluated on chest CT examination. Age, pulmonary function, tumor marker, and cancer stage were also assessed. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify any correlation to overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Hazard rate estimation and competing risk analysis were done to evaluate recurrence pattern. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 56.2 months. Tumors were located centrally in 230 patients (60.2%) and peripherally in 152 patients (39.8%). Age (p = 0.002, hazard ratio [HR] 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.01, 1.06]) and interstitial lung abnormalities (ILAs) (p<0.001, HR 5.41, 95% CI = [3.08, 9.52]) were associated with poor OS on multivariate analysis. ILAs also had a strong association to DFS (p<0.001, HR 4.25, 95% CI = [3.08, 9.52]). Central cancers had two peaks of local recurrence development at 15 and 60 months after surgery, and peripheral tumors showed rising curves for metastasis development at 60 months. CONCLUSIONS: CT-determined ILAs are a strong biomarker predicting poor outcome. Prognosis may not vary according to tumor location, but the two groups exhibited different recurrence patterns.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 21327531\nTitle: Prognostic factors for post-recurrence survival in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients with recurrence after resection.\nAuthors: Hsu PK, Wang BY, Huang CS\nJournal: Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract\nPublication Date: 2011 Apr\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE: The survival of recurrent esophageal cancer is poor. But reports regarding prognostic factors for post-recurrence survival are limited. We analyzed the recurrence pattern and the prognostic factors for post-recurrence survival in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with recurrence after resection. METHODS: Two hundred sixty-eight patients were included. Tumor recurrence occurred in 115 (42.9%) patients. Recurrence pattern was classified as locoregional, distant, and combined recurrence. The post-recurrence survival was defined as the interval between initial recurrence and either death or the last follow-up. RESULTS: Mediastinum lymphadenopathy was the most common site for locoregional recurrence, whereas lung, liver, and bone were the most common sites for distant recurrence. The overall 1- and 2-year post-recurrence survival rates were 32.6% and 12.6% with a median survival after recurrence of 6.0 months. The independent prognostic factors included liver recurrence (HR = 2.255, 95%CI = 1.073-4.741, p = 0.032), time to recurrence </=10 months (HR = 2.657, 95%CI = 1.438-4.911, p = 0.002), and no treatment for recurrences (HR = 2.745, 95%CI = 1.635-4.608, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We identify liver recurrence, early recurrence, and no treatment for recurrence as risk factors for dismal post-recurrence survival.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Here's a breakdown of relevant findings:\n\n*   **SCC vs. Adenocarcinoma:** Article #1 highlights that squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) has a higher recurrence rate and shorter disease-free survival compared to adenocarcinoma. This is a significant factor in our patient's case.\n*   **Histopathological Features:** Article #1 identifies lymphovascular invasion (LVI), vascular invasion (VI), visceral pleural invasion (VPI), and tumor spread through air spaces (STAS) as negative prognostic factors. We don't have information on these specific features from the provided files.\n*   **Interstitial Lung Abnormalities (ILAs):** Article #2 points to ILAs as a strong biomarker for poor outcomes. This information is not available in the provided data.\n*   **Recurrence Patterns:** Article #2 notes different recurrence patterns for central vs. peripheral tumors. Our patient's tumor location (upper lobe) isn't definitively stated, but it's likely central.\n*   **Time to Recurrence:** Article #3 emphasizes that a shorter time to recurrence is associated with worse post-recurrence survival.\n\nConsidering the patient's diagnosis of SCC, the lack of reported adverse histopathological features (LVI, VI, VPI, STAS), and the fact that multiple CT scans have shown no evidence of progression for a period, the risk of recurrence in the next 12 months remains relatively low, but not zero.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This open-label, single-arm study enrolled patients with SqCC of the lung who had progressed during/after first-line chemotherapy and comprised two parts: a safety run-in to establish the recommended phase II dose (RP2D; afatinib 40 mg or 30 mg once daily with pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks); and the main part assessing efficacy and safety of the RP2D. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR); secondary endpoints included the RP2D, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were treated in the safety run-in (afatinib 40 mg/30 mg cohorts: n = 12/12). Median age was 63.5 years; 79.2% of patients were male. All patients discontinued afatinib and pembrolizumab, most commonly due to disease progression (58.3% and 75.0%, respectively) or adverse events (AEs; 37.5% and 25.0%, respectively). The study was discontinued early after completion of the safety run-in, and no patients entered the main part. ORR was 12.5%; median PFS and OS were 13.1 and 29.3 weeks, respectively. All patients had >/= 1 drug-related AE (grade >/= 3: 45.8%). CONCLUSION: While there were no new or unexpected safety findings, exploratory analysis of antitumor activity indicated limited efficacy with afatinib plus pembrolizumab in patients with SqCC of the lung who had progressed during/after first-line chemotherapy.

Herein, retrospective medical record research was performed to investigate real-world treatment patterns and identify the prognostic factors among LUSC patients. A total of 173 patients with a median age of 68 years were enrolled for analysis. Males were predominant (n = 143, 83%) and current or ex-smokers contributed to 78% of the entire cohort. Pleura and lung were the most common metastatic sites, whereas brain metastasis was only 7%. After diagnosis, however, only 107 patients (62%) had received first-line chemotherapy. In the chemotherapy cohort, median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 3.9 and 11.1 months, respectively. After multivariable analysis, bone metastasis and the use of first-line single-agent chemotherapy independently predicted shorter PFS. For baseline characteristics, male sex, metastasis to lung, pleura, liver, and bone independently predicted worse OS. Regarding the treatment pattern, patients who had undergone standard first-line doublet therapy and employed targeted therapies after disease progression linked to longer OS. In the real world, even those who underwent chemotherapy still had poor outcome. The findings may help clinicians to orchestrate the treatment strategies for LUSC patients and provide further direction of large-scale studies.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 28729180\nTitle: Symptom and Quality of Life Improvement in LUX-Lung 8, an Open-Label Phase III Study of Second-Line Afatinib Versus Erlotinib in Patients With Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Lung After First-Line Platinum-Based Chemotherapy.\nAuthors: Felip E, Hirsh V, Popat S\nJournal: Clinical lung cancer\nPublication Date: 2018 Jan\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION: In the phase III LUX-Lung 8 trial, afatinib significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) versus erlotinib in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung progressing during or after platinum-based chemotherapy. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and health-related quality of life (QoL) in these patients are presented. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (n = 795) were randomized 1:1 to oral afatinib (40 mg/d) or erlotinib (150 mg/d). PROs were collected (baseline, every 28 days until progression, 28 days after discontinuation) using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QoL questionnaire and lung cancer-specific module. The percentage of patients improved during therapy, time to deterioration (TTD), and changes over time were analyzed for prespecified lung cancer-related symptoms and global health status (GHS)/QoL. RESULTS: Questionnaire compliance was 77.3% to 99.0% and 68.7% to 99.0% with afatinib and erlotinib, respectively. Significantly more patients who received afatinib versus erlotinib experienced improved scores for GHS/QoL (36% vs. 28%; P = .041) and cough (43% vs. 35%; P = .029). Afatinib significantly delayed TTD in dyspnea (P = .008) versus erlotinib, but not cough (P = .256) or pain (P = .869). Changes in mean scores favored afatinib for cough (P = .0022), dyspnea (P = .0007), pain (P = .0224), GHS/QoL (P = .0320), and all functional scales. Differences in adverse events between afatinib and erlotinib, specifically diarrhea, did not affect GHS/QoL. CONCLUSION: In patients with SCC of the lung, second-line afatinib was associated with improved prespecified disease-related symptoms and GHS/QoL versus erlotinib, complementing PFS and OS benefits with afatinib.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Methods: The clinical data of 290 patients with pathologically diagnosed stage \u2162A-N2 NSCLC after curative resection and adjuvant chemotherapy from January 2010 to December 2014 at our department were retrospectively analyzed. The survival and recurrence patterns were observed, and the factors affecting locoregional recurrence were analyzed. Results: The median survival time was 31.5 months. The 1-, 3-and 5-year survival rates were 88.3%, 46.0% and 33.2%, respectively. The median locoregional control time was 38.5 months. The 1-, 3-and 5-year locoregional control rates were 78.6%, 55.2% and 41.0%, respectively. The median distant metastasis-free survival was 26.8 months. The 1-, 3-and 5-year distant metastasis-free survival rates were 76.4%, 45.5% and 39.5%, respectively. The median progression-free survival was 19.1 months. The 1-, 3-and 5-year progression-free survival rates were 64.1%, 32.5% and 23.8%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that clinical N status, histological type, pathological T stage, operation mode, the number of positive N2 lymph nodes and the number of positive N2 lymph node stations had a significant influence on overall survival; clinical N status, histological type, the number of positive N2 lymph nodes and the number of positive N2 lymph node stations had a significant influence on locoregional control. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the number of N2 positive lymph nodes (P= 0.017) was an independent factor for overall survival of stage \u2162A-N2 patients; the number of N2 positive lymph nodes (P=0.009) and histological type (P=0.005) were independent factors for locoregional recurrence. For left-sided lung cancer, the lymph node station failure sites were mostly in 2R, 4R, 5, 6 and 7, and the contralateral mediastinum was frequently involved. For right-sided lung cancer, the lymph node station failure sites were mostly in 2R, 4R, 7, 10R and surgical stump. Conclusions: Clinical N2, squamous cell carcinoma, positive N2 nodes of more than 3 and multiple positive N2 stations are poor prognostic factors for locoregional recurrence. Locoregional recurrence of left lung cancer frequently involves the contralateral mediastinum, while that of the right lung cancer usually locates in the ipsilateral mediastinum.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 28168388\nTitle: External Validation of a Survival Nomogram for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Using the National Cancer Database.\nAuthors: Young KA, Efiong E, Dove JT\nJournal: Annals of surgical oncology\nPublication Date: 2017 Jun\nAbstract: PURPOSE: Survival nomograms offer individualized predictions using a more diverse set of factors than traditional staging measures, including the American Joint Committee on Cancer Tumor Node Metastasis (AJCC TNM) Staging System. A nomogram predicting overall survival (OS) for resected, non-metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been previously derived from Asian patients. The present study aims to determine the nomogram's predictive capability in the US using the National Cancer Database (NCDB). METHODS: This was a retrospective review of adults with resected, non-metastatic NSCLC entered into the NCDB between 2004 and 2012. Concordance indices and calibration plots analyzed discrimination and calibration, respectively. Multivariate analysis was also used. RESULTS: A total of 57,313 patients were included in this study. The predominant histologies were adenocarcinoma (48.2%) and squamous cell carcinoma (31.3%), and patients were diagnosed with stage I-A (38.3%), stage I-B (22.7%), stage II-A (14.2%), stage II-B (11.5%), and stage III-A (13.3%). Median OS was 74 months. 1-, 3- and 5-year OS rates were 89.8% [95% confidence interval (CI) 89.5-90.0%], 71.1% (95% CI 70.7-71.6%), and 55.7% (95% CI 54.7-56.6%), respectively. The nomogram's concordance index (C-index) was 0.804 (95% CI 0.792-0.817). AJCC TNM staging demonstrated higher discrimination (C-index 0.833, 95% CI 0.821-0.840). CONCLUSIONS: The nomogram's individualized estimates accurately predicted survival in this patient collective, demonstrating higher discrimination in this population than in the developer's cohorts. However, the generalized survival estimates provided by traditional staging demonstrated superior predictive capability; therefore, AJCC TNM staging should remain the gold standard for the prognostication of resected NSCLC in the US.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 36357868\nTitle: Surgery versus radiotherapy in octogenarians with stage Ia non\u2011small cell lung cancer: propensity score matching analysis of the SEER database.\nAuthors: Ni L, Lin G, Zhang Z\nJournal: BMC pulmonary medicine\nPublication Date: 2022 Nov 10\nAbstract: OBJECTIVES: To compare overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) outcomes of surgery with radiotherapy in octogenarians with stage Ia non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients aged >/= 80 years with clinical stage Ia (T1N0M0) NSCLC between 2012 and 2017 were identified from the population-based Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Patients were assigned into surgery and radiotherapy groups. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to identify survival-associated factors. Treatment groups were adjusted by propensity score matching (PSM) analysis while OS and CSS outcomes were compared among groups by Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1641 patients were identified, with 46.0% in the surgical group and 54.0% in the radiotherapy group. Compared to surgery, radiotherapy-treated patients were older, later diagnosed, had more often unmarried, more squamous cell carcinoma, more unknown grade and increased tumor sizes. Radiotherapy was associated with a significantly worse OS, compared to surgery (hazard ratio 2.426; 95% CI 2.003-2.939; P < .001). After PSM, OS (P < 0.001) and CSS (P < 0.001) were higher in the surgery group. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates of surgical and radiotherapy group were 90.0%, 76.9%, 59.9%, and 86.0%, 54.3%, 28.0%, respectively. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year CSS rates of surgical and radiotherapy group were 94.5%, 86.1%, 78.0% and 90.7%, 74.5%, 61.0%, respectively. There were no survival differences between the matched surgery without lymph node examination (LNE) and radiotherapy group, as well as between the matched surgery and radiotherapy who were recommended but refused surgery group. CONCLUSIONS: In octogenarians with stage Ia NSCLC, surgery with lymph node dissection offers better OS and CSS outcomes than radiotherapy.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 98 patients with advanced lung cancer or recurrent lung cancer after the standard therapies were enrolled retrospectively. The bronchial arteries and mediastinal branches from the subclavian artery were selected by a microcatheter. Immediately after the selective arterial infusion of anti-neoplastic agents, embolization with a spherical embolic material was carried out. Local tumor effects and overall survival were evaluated. RESULT: The mean reduction rate was 17.9%, with 24.2% for partial remission and with 2.1% for progression disease. The rate of stable disease was 72.6%. The response rate was 25.3%, and the disease control rate was 97.9%. The median survival time (MST) was 11.4 months, the 1-year survival rate was 45.2%, and the 2-year survival rate was 35.6%. Although it is insignificant, the MST for 51 adenocarcinomas was higher than that of 29 squamous cell carcinomas (18.6 months and 9.4 months, respectively). The local extension of tumors related to a better prognosis, though it was not significant. Lymph node metastases and distant metastases were poor prognostic factors. No major complications nor treatment-related mortalities were found in this study.

METHODS: Patients with locally advanced lung SCC (stage IIIA, IIIB) who received PD-1 inhibitor combined with nab-PTX and NED between February 2019 and June 2021 in Weihai Municipal Hospital were included and underwent surgical treatment 4 weeks after 2-4 cycles neoadjuvant therapy. The rate of resection R0, the effective rate, the complete pathological remission rate (pCR) and the rate of major pathological remission (MPR) were observed. RESULTS: A total of 14 initially unresectable male patients with lung SCC were included and received neoadjuvant treatment after evaluation. Nine out of 14 patients (64.3%) experienced treatment-related adverse events (TRAE), among which 8 (57.1%) experienced grade (G) I-II TRAEs including nausea, vomiting, fatigue, constipation, elevated ALT and AST, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, rash, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia, and 1 (7.1%) experienced grade III-V TRAEs (G), including granulocytopenia and atelectasis. Thirteen patients (92.86%) achieved RECIST-assessed partial remission (PR), while 1 patient (7.14%) achieved stable disease (SD) on imaging assessment after neoadjuvant treatment and continued to be progression-free for 26 months. Of the 11 patients who underwent resection, all were alive and recurrence/progression-free. MPR and pCR were observed in 2 (18.18%) and 9 (81.82%), respectively. IHC results exhibited that all NSCLC patients exhibited positive PD-L1 expression (9/14, TPS >/=50% or greater; 5/14, 1% < TPS < 50%). Two were negative for ALK, EGFR, and ros-1, and the rest were not examined for driver oncogene mutation.

PDT was carried out with the use of chlorine E6 (Radachlorin) and light wavelength of 662 nm. Overall response rate after neoadjuvant treatment was 82 %, endoscopic remission was observed in 21 of 22 patients (95%). 10 patients underwent pneumonectomy, 12--lobectomy. 19 surgical interventions were regarded as radical (R0--86%), 3--as microscopically non-radical (R1--14%). Degree of lymphatic metastasis spreading pN0 was detected in 6 patients (27 %), pN1--in 14 (64%) and pN2--in 2 patients (9%). Surgical lethality was 5%. In the late time of the whole observation period none of the patients developed local recurrence. One-year survival was 95%, 3-year--91%. PDT can play an important role in combination with surgical treatment for NSCLC and reduces the amount of resection in part of initially unresectable or inoperable patients.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Although the occurrence of late metastatic recurrence in the lung is relatively rare, we present the case of a 52-year-old woman, previously diagnosed and treated for CSCC. After 4 years of disease-free intervals, she presented with respiratory symptoms, including cough, dyspnea, and hemoptysis, with marked asthenia. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest revealed a lung mass. Histopathological examination of the lung biopsy confirmed the recurrence of CSCC, specifically in the lung. Immunohistochemistry further supported the origin of the tumor as cervical. The management of such cases necessitates a multidisciplinary approach, considering treatment options such as surgery and chemoradiation. Long-term follow-up and surveillance are vital for the early detection of late recurrences, as they can present several years after the initial diagnosis. This case report highlights the importance of recognizing and appropriately managing cases of late metastatic recurrence of CSCC in the lung. Further studies are needed to deepen our understanding of the underlying mechanisms, refine diagnostic approaches, and optimize treatment strategies for such rare occurrences.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 22252562\nTitle: Preliminary report of late recurrences, at 5 years or more, after stereotactic body radiation therapy for non-small cell lung cancer.\nAuthors: Matsuo Y, Shibuya K, Nagata Y\nJournal: Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer\nPublication Date: 2012 Feb\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION: Long-term outcomes remain unknown after stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). We observed a few patients who developed disease progression late, at 5 years or more, after SBRT. In this report, we describe the characteristics of those patients with late recurrence after SBRT. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent SBRT for non-small cell lung cancer with histological confirmation between January 1999 and December 2005 at our institution. During this period, 48 Gy of SBRT in four fractions at the isocenter was prescribed for all patients. RESULTS: In total, 66 patients were eligible. With a median follow-up period of 35.9 months, the 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 44.6% (95% confidence interval, 33.5-59.5%) and 33.8% (95% confidence interval, 23.6-48.4%), respectively. Of the patients, 16 survived without disease progression for 5 years or more after SBRT. Of these, four patients developed late recurrence at 76, 101, 108, and 109 months after SBRT. Three of the patients were females with adenocarcinomas; the other was a male with squamous cell carcinoma. The initial sites of recurrence were local in two patients, distant in one, and simultaneously local and distant in one. A total of two patients with local recurrence alone were still alive at 138 months after SBRT. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of late recurrence was not negligible in long-term survivors after SBRT.

The concept of oligometastasis has been developed, and limited distant metastases have been considered as indications for surgical resection for the purpose of extending overall survival. We herein present a long-surviving case of super-late pulmonary recurrence of ESCC, seven years after radical esophagectomy. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 71-year-old woman who underwent radical subtotal esophagectomy with three-field lymph node dissection with a diagnosis of an advanced poorly differentiated ESCC with cT3N1M0 seven years ago visited our hospital. Chest X-ray and computed tomography at the 7-year follow-up revealed a solitary pulmonary tumor, 1.5 cm in diameter, at the right middle lobe without any extrapulmonary metastases; however, we could not diagnose whether primary lung cancer or pulmonary metastasis of ESCC was present. Therefore, we performed thoracoscopic partial resection of the right middle lobe. A histopathological examination including immunohistochemical staining revealed that the tumor was not derived from both alveolar epithelium and neuroendocrine cells and was diagnosed as pulmonary oligometastasis of ESCC. She has been followed for four years without re-recurrence. CONCLUSION: Pulmonary oligometastases of ESCC should be considered as surgical indications if the tumor is detected after a long disease-free interval without any extrapulmonary recurrences.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Rogaratinib is a novel oral pan-FGFR inhibitor with a good safety profile and anti-tumor activity in early clinical trials as a single agent in FGFR pathway-addicted tumors. SAKK 19/18 determined clinical activity of rogaratinib in patients with advanced SQCLC overexpressing FGFR1-3 mRNA. METHODS: Patients with advanced SQCLC failing standard systemic treatment and with FGFR1-3 mRNA tumor overexpression as defined in the protocol received rogaratinib 600 mg BID until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. A 6-months progression-free survival rate (6mPFS) </=15 % was considered uninteresting (H0), whereas a 6mPFS >/=38 % was considered promising (H1). According to a Simon 2-stage design, 2 out of 10 patients of the first stage were required to be progression-free at 6 months. Comprehensive Genomic Profiling was performedusing the Oncomine Comprehensive Assay Plus (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RESULTS: Between July 2019 and November 2020, 49 patients were screened and 20 were classified FGFR-positive. Among a total of 15 patients, 6mPFS was reached in 1 patient (6.7 %), resulting in trial closure for futility after the first stage. There were 7 (46.7 %) patients with stable disease and 5 (33.3 %) patients with progressive disease. Median PFS was 1.6 (95 % CI 0.9-3.5) months and median overall survival (OS) 3.5 (95 % CI 1.0-5.9) months. Most frequent treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) included hyperphosphatemia in 8 (53 %), diarrhea in 5 (33 %), stomatitis in 3 (20 %) and nail changes in 3 (20 %) patients. Grade >/=3 TRAEs occurred in 6 (40 %) patients. No associations between mutational profile and treatment outcome were observed. CONCLUSION: Despite preliminary signals of activity, rogaratinib failed to improve PFS in patients with advanced SQCLC overexpressing FGFR mRNA. FGFR inhibitors in SQCLC remain a challenging field, and more in-depth understanding of pathway crosstalks may lead to the development of drug combinations with FGFR inhibitors resulting in improved outcomes.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 33221175\nTitle: A Phase II Study of Telisotuzumab Vedotin in Patients With c-MET-positive Stage IV or Recurrent Squamous Cell Lung Cancer (LUNG-MAP Sub-study S1400K, NCT03574753).\nAuthors: Waqar SN, Redman MW, Arnold SM\nJournal: Clinical lung cancer\nPublication Date: 2021 May\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION: Lung-MAP S1400K was designed to evaluate the response to telisotuzumab vedotin, an antibody-drug conjugate targeting c-MET, in patients with c-MET-positive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with previously treated SCC with c-MET-positive tumors (H score >/= 150, Ventana SP44 assay) were enrolled into 2 cohorts: Cohort 1 (immune checkpoint inhibitor-naive) and Cohort 2 (immune checkpoint inhibitor refractory). Telisotuzumab vedotin 2.7 mg/kg was administered intravenously every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Response assessments were performed every 6 weeks. The primary endpoint was response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, overall survival, response within cohort, duration of response, and toxicities. Interim analysis was planned after 20 evaluable patients, with >/= 3 responses needed to continue enrollment. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients (14% of screened patients) were assigned to S1400K, 28 patients enrolled (15 in Cohort 1 and 13 in Cohort 2), and 23 were eligible. S1400K closed on December 21, 2018 owing to lack of efficacy. Two responses (response rate of 9%; 95% confidence interval, 0%-20%) were reported in cohort 1 (1 complete and 1 unconfirmed partial response), whereas 10 patients had stable disease, with a disease control rate of 52%. The median overall and progression-free survival was 5.6 and 2.4 months, respectively. There were 3 grade 5 events (2 pneumonitis, in Cohort 2, and 1 bronchopulmonary hemorrhage, in Cohort 1).

The articles focus on:\n\n*   **Article #1:** Transarterial treatment \u2013 not relevant to the patient\u2019s current stable state.\n*   **Article #2:** A failed clinical trial of rogaratinib \u2013 focuses on progression, not stable disease.\n*   **Article #3:** A failed clinical trial of telisotuzumab vedotin \u2013 also focuses on progression and toxicity.\n\nTherefore, I must rely on my internal knowledge and the previously established information. Given the patient\u2019s age (53), Stage 1-3 diagnosis, stable disease for over a year, and ECOG performance status of 1, the probability of being alive in the next 9 months is very high. While recurrence is always a possibility, the patient currently demonstrates a good response to initial treatment and no evidence of progression.\n\n[ANSWER: A]"
