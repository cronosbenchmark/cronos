Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nCapecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers. Capecitabine is a prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to fluorouracil (antimetabolite) in the tumor, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor tissue.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0039020-T01-IM6\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0039020\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Pancreatic Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Pancreas\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT468\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 422, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 20.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"PAAD\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

The cancer was regional to lymph nodes. The MSI status is stable. The patient received several rounds of chemotherapy with FOLFOX (Leucovorin, Oxaliplatin, Fluorouracil) and Irinotecan, followed by Capecitabine and radiation therapy. CT scans performed throughout the treatment period consistently showed \"no progression\" of the cancer. CA 19-9 levels fluctuated, initially decreasing during treatment, then rising again towards the end of the timeline, but remaining within a relatively normal range until the final measurement at age 63.048 where it increased significantly to 95 Units/ml.\n\nGiven the consistent \"no progression\" on CT scans and the initial response in CA 19-9 levels, the treatment appears to have been effective in controlling the cancer. However, the recent increase in CA 19-9 at age 63.048 is concerning and could indicate early recurrence.\n\nPancreatic cancer has a high rate of recurrence, even after complete resection and adjuvant chemotherapy. The risk of recurrence depends on several factors, including the stage of the cancer, the completeness of resection, the patient's response to chemotherapy, and the presence of specific genetic mutations.\n\n[PUBMED: pancreatic cancer recurrence risk factors]\n\nBased on the information available, it is difficult to definitively predict whether the cancer will recur in the next 6 months.

However, the rate of recurrence remains high, particularly within the first 6 months, and is associated with a poor prognosis. The present study evaluated the clinical characteristics and risk factors for early recurrence in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients who underwent curative resection, regardless of the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, to identify predictive factors associated with early recurrence and poor outcomes as well as to determine the optimal treatment strategy for patients at high risk of early recurrence after surgical resection. METHODS: Patients who underwent pancreatic resection for PDAC at our institution from 2013 to 2021 were included in this study. We investigated the clinicopathological features of patients in groups: those with recurrence within 6 months, recurrence between 6 and 12 months, and recurrence beyond 12 months or no recurrence. A logistic regression analysis identified covariates associated with early recurrence at 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: The study included 403 patients with a median follow-up of 25.7 months. Recurrence was observed in 279 patients, with 14.6% recurring within 6 months, 23.3% within 6-12 months, and 62% after 12 months or not at all. The preoperative CA19-9 level, modified Glasgow prognostic score (mGPS), and positive peritoneal cytology were significant risk factors for early recurrence within 6 months, while positive peritoneal cytology, lymph node metastasis, and the absence of adjuvant chemotherapy were significant risk factors for recurrence within 12 months. For patients who received preoperative chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy, the preoperative CA19-9 level, mGPS, and positive peritoneal cytology were significant independent risk factors for early recurrence within 6 months, while positive peritoneal cytology, lymph node metastasis, and the absence of adjuvant chemotherapy were significant independent risk factors for recurrence within 12 months. The study concluded that the overall survival after surgical resection for potentially resectable PDAC worsened according to the number of risk factors present in the patient. CONCLUSIONS: We clarified that preoperative CA19-9, positive peritoneal cytology, and the lack of adjuvant chemotherapy were consistent predictors for early recurrence within 6 and 12 months. In addition, an increased number of risk factors affecting the patient was associated with a poorer overall survival after potentially curable resection. Calculating the number of risk factors for early recurrence may be an essential predictive factor when considering treatment strategies.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 29771771\nTitle: A Therapeutic Strategy for Resectable Pancreatic Cancer Based on Risk Factors of Early Recurrence.\nAuthors: Kurahara H, Maemura K, Mataki Y\nJournal: Pancreas\nPublication Date: 2018 Jul\nAbstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for early recurrence and assess the prognostic benefit of neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) for resectable pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Patients with radiographically resectable pancreatic cancer according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines were enrolled. We regarded recurrence within 6 months after surgery as early recurrence. RESULTS: This study involved 115 patients (80 who underwent upfront surgery and 35 who received NAT). Serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 greater than 85 U/mL and p53 expression in 0 or more than 80% of tumor cells were independent risk factors for early recurrence after upfront surgery. We classified patients into a high-risk group (1 or 2 risk factors) and a low-risk group (no risk factors). In the high-risk group, the median overall survival time of patients with NAT was significantly longer than that of patients without NAT (P = 0.028). By contrast, the median overall survival time was not different according to NAT in the low-risk group. CONCLUSIONS: Serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 and p53 expression of the primary tumor could be predictors of early recurrence in patients with resectable pancreatic cancer. The prognosis of patients with a high risk of early recurrence may be improved using NAT.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 39103253\nTitle: Recurrence pattern and its risk factors in patients with resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma - A retrospective analysis of 272 patients.\nAuthors: Brunner M, Flessa M, Jacobsen A\nJournal: Pancreatology : official journal of the International Association of Pancreatology (IAP) ... [et al.]\nPublication Date: 2024 Sep\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the patterns of recurrence and their associated risk factors in patients who underwent resection for pancreatic carcinoma. METHODS: This retrospective study included 272 patients, who underwent Ro/R1-resection of PDAC from 2005 to 2020 at the University Hospital Erlangen. Risk factors for different recurrence patterns and the prognostic value of recurrence pattern on the overall survival after recurrence were evaluated. RESULTS: 61 % of the patients experienced recurrence, mostly within the first 12 postoperative months (62 %) and in the form of metastases (87 %). The median overall survival from recurrence was 9.2 months. The preoperative absence of diabetes and the presence of lymph node metastasis were independent risk factors for recurrence and a preoperative CA19-9 exceeding 97 U/ml for early recurrence. Additionally, lymph node metastases were associated with a higher risk of metastatic recurrence. Early recurrence, but not the site of recurrence, was identified as an independent prognostic factor for worse overall survival from recurrence. CONCLUSION: The occurrence of recurrence and especially of early and metastatic recurrence are associated with a worse overall survival. Patients lacking preoperative diabetes, having high preoperative CA19-9 values and lymph node metastases are particularly at risk for (early) recurrence.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nCapecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers. Capecitabine is a prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to fluorouracil (antimetabolite) in the tumor, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor tissue.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

The provision of survival scenarios-that is, best-case, typical and worst-case scenarios-could prove valuable to patients and clinicians. This study investigated survival scenarios and how these have changed over a period of 16 years for patients with PAC. Data from the Netherlands Cancer Registry were used to identify patients with localized and metastatic PAC (2005-2021). Survival scenarios, including best-case, upper-typical, typical (median), lower-typical, and worst-case, were estimated based on survival curve percentiles (p10, p25, p50, p75, and p90). Annual differences were assessed for significance using weighted linear regression analyses. Factors associated with these scenarios were identified through univariable tests. Overall, 14,622 patients with localized and 20,199 with metastatic PAC were included. For patients with localized PAC, the best, upper-typical and typical survival scenarios improved statistically significant with average annual improvement of 1.54 (95%CI: 1.2-1.88), 0.67 (0.56-0.78), and 0.24 (0.19-0.29) months, respectively. For patients with metastatic PAC the best and upper-typical survival scenarios increased statically significantly with annual improvement of 0.28 (0.21-0.34) and 0.06 (0.02-0.09) months, respectively. The best-case and upper-typical scenarios were associated with younger patients, more aggressive disease-focused treatments, fewer comorbidities, and better overall performance status. Over the past 16 years, survival improvements in patients with PAC have been most notable in these scenarios. Although the absolute gains were modest, these results offer encouraging potential for advancements in life-prolonging care for this type of cancer.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 31527373\nTitle: Long-Term Survival Outcomes of Metabolically Supported Chemotherapy with Gemcitabine-Based or FOLFIRINOX Regimen Combined with Ketogenic Diet, Hyperthermia, and Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy in Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer.\nAuthors: Iyikesici MS\nJournal: Complementary medicine research\nPublication Date: 2020\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Despite introduction of new chemotherapeutic agents, outcomes of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer are still poor. Metabolically supported chemotherapy (MSCT) is a novel approach targeting dysregulated energy mechanism of the tumor cell. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine the efficacy of metabolically supported administration of chemotherapy combined with ketogenic diet, hyperthermia, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. METHOD: This retrospective observational study included 25 patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal carcinoma (stage IV) who received MSCT (either gemcitabine-based or FOLFIRINOX regimen administered concomitantly with induced hypoglycemia) plus ketogenic diet, hyperthermia, and HBOT combination. Survival outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: During the mean follow-up duration of 25.4 +/- 19.3 months, median overall survival and median progression-free survival were 15.8 months (95% CI, 10.5-21.1) and 12.9 months (95% CI, 11.2-14.6), respectively. Age and gender did not have any effect on overall survival (p > 0.05 for all). CONCLUSIONS: MSCT administered together with ketogenic diet, hyperthermia, and HBOT appears to be a viable option with the potential to improve survival outcomes in patients diagnosed with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Further research, particularly with larger comparative clinical trials, is warranted.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 26124362\nTitle: Predicting Survival After Irradiation of Metastases from Pancreatic Cancer.\nAuthors: Bolm L, Janssen S, Kasmann L\nJournal: Anticancer research\nPublication Date: 2015 Jul\nAbstract: BACKGROUND/AIM: Patients with metastases from pancreas cancer benefit from individualized care, including radiotherapy for symptom control. To administer the optimal radiation therapy, it is important to understand a patient's prognosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seven variables were analyzed regarding their relationship with survival: age, gender, Karnofsky performance score (KPS), number of metastatic sites, interval from diagnosis of pancreatic cancer to irradiation of metastases, type of irradiated metastasis, and radiation dose. RESULTS: On univariate analysis, survival was positively associated with age </= 67 years (p=0.045), KPS >70 (p<0.001), and involvement of only one metastatic site (p=0.013). A longer interval between diagnosis and irradiation of metastases showed a trend for better survival (p=0.077). On multivariate analysis, age [risk ratio (RR)=4.29; p=0.004], KPS (RR=1.95; p=0.020), number of metastatic sites (RR=2.20; p=0.009) and interval to irradiation (RR=4.41; p=0.005) achieved significance. CONCLUSION: The present study identified four independent predictors of survival in patients with pancreatic cancer irradiated for metastasis and thus contributes to treatment optimization.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
