Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0039147-T01-IM6\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0039147\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Colorectal Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Ascending Colon\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Colon Adenocarcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT468\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 522, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 50.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"COAD\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

CEA levels fluctuate, rising to 8.7 ng/ml at age 72.600.\n*   **ECOG Performance Status:** Initially 0, fluctuating to 1 and then to 2 during treatment, and back to 1 at 72.605.\n\n**Key Findings from `specimen.txt`:**\n\n*   Confirms the initial diagnosis of Colon Adenocarcinoma, MSI Stable, localized at the Cecum.\n*   TMB (Tumor Mutational Burden) is 9.51, which is relatively low.\n\n**Analysis and Risk Assessment:**\n\nThe patient initially presented with localized disease but experienced progression to liver metastasis during the course of treatment. While recent scans suggest stability, the indeterminate PET scan and fluctuating CEA levels raise concern. The fact that the cancer *has* progressed previously significantly increases the risk of further recurrence. MSS status is generally associated with a lower response to immunotherapy, and a lower TMB may also limit response to some therapies.\n\nGiven the history of progression, the fluctuating CEA levels, and the indeterminate PET scan, I believe there is a significant risk of recurrence within the next 6 months.\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"

Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: timeline1.txt] included in your context\nAGE: 72.948, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: Yes, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 72.948, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: Yes, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 72.948, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 72.948, diagnosis > progression --> PROGRESSION: Indeterminate, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, \nAGE: 72.948, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), CT, TUMOR_SITE: Bone, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 72.956, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 4.7000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 72.989, diagnosis > performance_status --> ECOG: 0, \nAGE: 73.046, surgery --> SUBTYPE: SAMPLE, \nAGE: 73.060, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: PET, HAS_CANCER: Yes, PROCEDURE_TYPE: PET, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: Yes, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 73.060, diagnosis > progression --> PROGRESSION: Y, PROCEDURE_TYPE: PET, \nAGE: 73.060, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), PET, TUMOR_SITE: Bone, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, HEAD: Yes, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 73.065, diagnosis > performance_status --> ECOG: 1, \nAGE: 73.136, treatment > radiation --> SUBTYPE: Radiation Therapy, \nAGE: 73.526, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: Yes, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 73.526, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has progressed.\nAGE: 73.526, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), CT, TUMOR_SITE: Bone, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 73.526, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 7.1000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 73.660, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: No, OTHER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 73.660, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 73.665, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: PET, HAS_CANCER: Yes, PROCEDURE_TYPE: PET, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: Yes, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 73.665, diagnosis > progression --> PROGRESSION: N, PROCEDURE_TYPE: PET, \nAGE: 73.665, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), PET, TUMOR_SITE: Bone, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, HEAD: Yes, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \n\n[DrugBank: Veal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0039147-T01-IM6\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0039147\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Colorectal Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Ascending Colon\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Colon Adenocarcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT468\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 522, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 50.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"COAD\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

Of 928 primary tumor resected colorectal cancer patients, 12 (1.3%) were identified with bone metastasis and included in this study. The majority of primary tumors were located at the rectosigmoid portion of the colon. All cases were highly advanced at the time of diagnosis, including 8 cases of stage IV by TNM classification. Sites of metastatic tumors were concentrated in lumber or pelvic bones. At the onset of bone metastasis, 9 of the 12 cases had other metastatic sites, i.e., only 3 patients had bone metastasis alone. Survival after onset of bone metastasis was very poor, with a median survival of approximately 5 months and a 20% survival rate at 1 year. With regard to cause of death, seven patients died of pulmonary failure, one of liver failure, and one of DIC. Only 2 cases of solitary osseous metastasis have survived more than 1 year. In order to significantly improve prognosis, the early detection of bone metastases is important.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 29722726\nTitle: Characteristics and Prognostic Factors of Bone Metastasis in Patients With Colorectal Cancer.\nAuthors: Kawamura H, Yamaguchi T, Yano Y\nJournal: Diseases of the colon and rectum\nPublication Date: 2018 Jun\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Because bone metastasis from colorectal cancer is rare, there are little available data regarding such cases. OBJECTIVE: The study aim was to identify the prognostic factors and characteristics associated with survival in colorectal cancer patients with bone metastasis. DESIGN: This was a retrospective study from a prospectively collected database. SETTINGS: The study took place in a multidisciplinary, high-volume tertiary cancer center in Japan. PATIENTS: Examined were records from 104 consecutive patients treated between 2004 and 2015 for bone metastasis from colorectal cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was overall survival. RESULTS: The spine was the most common site of bone metastasis from colorectal cancer. Right colon cancer correlated significantly with long bone metastasis (p = 0.046), whereas left colon cancer correlated significantly with spinal bone metastasis (p = 0.034). Liver metastasis was also significantly correlated with spinal bone metastasis (p = 0.036). The median interval between the primary therapy for colorectal cancer and the metachronous diagnosis of bone metastasis was 20.0 months (quartile 1 to quartile 3, 9.0-46.5 mo). The median survival time from diagnosis of bone metastasis from colorectal cancer was 5.0 months (95% CI, 4.0-9.0 mo), and the 1-year survival rate was 30.0% (95% CI, 21.1%-39.4%). Multivariate analysis revealed that >/=2 extra-bone metastatic organs, hypercalcemia, and pathologic fractures were independent poor prognostic factors (p < 0.001, 0.001, and 0.033). The number of extra-bone metastatic organs correlated with prognosis. LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by its retrospective, nonrandomized design, as well as selection bias and performance at a single institute. CONCLUSIONS: The location of colorectal cancer correlates significantly with the site of bone metastasis; the prognosis of patients with bone metastasis from colorectal cancer is very poor, and the significant prognostic factors are number of extra-bone metastatic organs, hypercalcemia, and pathologic fractures.

METHODS: The clinical characteristics of 25 patients with BM from CRC were retrospectively analyzed. The time of the occurrence of BM after diagnosis of CRC was recorded. Meanwhile, the time from the occurrence of lung, bone, liver, and other extracranial metastases to the occurrence of BM was also recorded. We evaluate the time factors affecting the length of the occurrence of BM and the potential prognostic factors after BM diagnosis. The influences of patients undergoing surgery-based comprehensive treatment, radiotherapy-based comprehensive treatment, and co-medication were also assessed. RESULTS: In patients with BM from CRC, lung metastases (13/25) occurred at a higher frequency than liver metastases (8/25) and bone metastases (6/25). The median time to the development of BM was much shorter (3.7 vs. 25.3 months, p = 0.027), with the brain being the origin site for the metastasis. The median overall survival reached 9.9 months. The interval between diagnosis of BM and bone, liver, and lung metastasis remains 3, 6.5, and 11 months, respectively. The brain lesions of patients with BM alone had higher rates in supratentorial (88.9%), while those with extracranial metastasis had a 62.5% incidence of infratentorial metastasis. The difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). The time of occurrence of BM in patients aged 67 years and younger was 16.1 and 30.1 months, respectively. The differences between them were statistically significant (p = 0.043). The BM time for left- and right-sided colon cancer were 26.5 and 7.8 months, representing a statistically significant difference (p = 0.015). The time to onset of BM for patients with and without the resection of primary lesions was 25.4 and 4.5 months. Statistically significant differences are shown (p = 0.007). Univariate analysis demonstrated that the prognosis of patients was related to the KPS score, the number of BM, the treatment methods, and the occurrence of lung metastasis (p < 0.05). The multivariate analysis revealed that the treatment modality and lung metastasis were independent prognostic factors for CRC patients with BM. Right-sided CRC patients with BM have a poor prognosis (8.1 vs. 10.2 months, p = 0.31). Although median survival time was not significantly different between patients with and without bevacizumab combination therapy, bevacizumab therapy is associated with a better survival time (9.9 vs. 7.1 months, p = 0.27). CONCLUSION: Patients with left-sided CRC, especially those with lung metastases, are prone to brain metastases, and patients with brain metastases as the first metastatic site have a higher rate of supratentorial metastases. Young patients with right hemicolon cancer and patients who have not undergone primary lesion resection have a shorter time for the occurrence of BM. Patients with colorectal lung metastases, especially those young with right-sided CRC, require close imaging surveillance of BM. The prognosis of CRC patients with BM and lung metastases is poor, and comprehensive treatment based on surgery could significantly prolong patients' survival time.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
