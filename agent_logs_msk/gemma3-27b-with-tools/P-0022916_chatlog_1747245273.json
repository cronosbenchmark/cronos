Oxaliplatin: Oxaliplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0022916-T01-IM6\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0022916\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Colorectal Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Rectum\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Rectal Adenocarcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT468\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 777, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 30.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"READ\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

While recurrence rates vary depending on stage and other factors, several key points are relevant here. MSS status is associated with a higher risk of recurrence compared to MSI-High status, but stage is a more significant predictor. Stage I-III rectal cancer has a 5-year recurrence rate ranging from 20-40%, with the highest risk in Stage III. However, the risk decreases over time. Adjuvant chemotherapy (like the FOLFOX regimen the patient received) significantly reduces the risk of recurrence. Regular surveillance with CEA monitoring and imaging is crucial for early detection of recurrence.\n\nConsidering the patient's initial localized disease (Stage 1-3), MSS status, completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, and the lack of evidence of progression on recent imaging, the probability of recurrence within the *next 9 months* is still relatively low, though not zero. The patient is being monitored with CEA levels, which is a good indicator.\n\nTherefore, my assessment remains:\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"

This is a report on the patterns of recurrence in a group of such patients treated with pelvic exenteration and radiotherapy. METHODS: Between 1980 and 1992, we treated 49 patients. Thirty-one received preoperative radiotherapy (pre-RT), 4,500 cGy. Six weeks later, we performed posterior pelvic exenteration (PPE) in 21 patients, and total pelvic exenteration (TPE) in 10. Nine patients received postoperative radiotherapy (post-RT), 5,000 cGy after a PPE. Nine patients had surgery only, PPE (n = 7) and TPE (n = 2). RESULTS: Surgical mortality occurred in 16% of those patients who received pre-RT. The median follow-up was 52 months. Recurrences occurred in 23% of those patients who received pre-RT (local, one; local/distant, one; distant, four); in 88% of those patients treated with surgery only (local/distant, four; distant, four); and in 11% of those treated with post-RT (distant, one). The 5-year survival for patients who received radiotherapy was 66 versus 44% for those treated with surgery only. CONCLUSION: Local control of locally advanced primary rectal adenocarcinoma requiring a pelvic exenteration is improved by the addition of radiotherapy. When recurrences do occur they are predominantly at extrapelvic sites.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 2742046\nTitle: Local recurrence after sphincter-saving resection for rectal adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Warneke J, Petrelli NJ, Herrera L\nJournal: American journal of surgery\nPublication Date: 1989 Jul\nAbstract: Local pelvic-perineal recurrences were evaluated in 40 patients who underwent a sphincter-saving resection for rectal adenocarcinoma at Roswell Park Memorial Institute. The length of follow-up was at least 5 years or until death in all but one patient. There were 24 women and 16 men with a median age of 63 years. In 31 patients, the resection was considered to be curative and was considered palliative in the remaining 9 patients. Seven of the 31 patients (23 percent) developed a local recurrence. Two of the seven local recurrences had further resection for curative intent, with one person alive at 88 months. Margins of resection were available in 27 patients. Local recurrence occurred in 4 of 8 patients with distal margins of resection less than 2 cm and in 3 of 19 patients with margins greater than 2 cm. When the lesion was less than 10 cm from the anal verge, local recurrence was more likely to occur than at margins above this level.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 10504668\nTitle: The influence of pre-operative radiation therapy on the patterns of recurrence in rectal adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Luna-Perez P, Rodriguez-Ramirez S, Gonzalez-Macouzet J\nJournal: Seminars in surgical oncology\nPublication Date: 1999 Oct-Nov\nAbstract: From January 1976 to December 1994, we evaluated the institutional experience of local recurrence and survival in patients with rectal adenocarcinoma treated with pre-operative radiation therapy (PRT) as compared to those treated with radical surgery alone. There were 412 patients, divided into two groups: 259 patients (142 males and 117 females) in Group I and 153 patients (88 males and 65 females) in Group II. The median age was 56 years. Group I patients with locally advanced tumors, either tethered or fixed, received PRT at doses of 45 Gy delivered to the pelvis in two fields; 4 to 8 weeks later, radical surgery was performed. Patients with mobile tumors underwent radical surgery only (Group II). The operative mortality was 4.6% in Group I as compared to 1.9% in Group II (P = 0.18). At median follow-up of 89 months, there were local recurrences in 12.9% of Group I as compared to 36.2% in Group II (P = 0.0000001). The administration of PRT was associated with a low rate of local recurrence, but this improvement corresponded with a high morbidity rate, especially in patients who underwent abdominoperineal resection or pelvic exenteration.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

These articles focus on patterns of recurrence, particularly relating to surgical approaches (sphincter-saving resection, pelvic exenteration) and the role of pre-operative radiation therapy. They highlight that local recurrence *is* a significant concern in rectal adenocarcinoma, but the rate varies considerably based on treatment strategy and disease extent.\n\nThe articles emphasize:\n\n*   **Local vs. Distant Recurrence:** Recurrence can be local (in the pelvis/perineum) or distant (e.g., liver, lungs).\n*   **Importance of Margins:** Close surgical margins are associated with a higher risk of local recurrence.\n*   **Role of Radiation:** Pre-operative radiation therapy can reduce local recurrence rates.\n*   **Pelvic Exenteration:** Used for locally advanced disease, but carries significant morbidity.\n\nHowever, these articles don't directly address the recurrence risk in a patient *after* completing adjuvant chemotherapy (FOLFOX), which our patient received. They also don't provide specific recurrence rates for Stage 1-3 MSS disease post-chemotherapy.\n\nConsidering the totality of the information \u2013 the initial staging, MSS status, completion of FOLFOX chemotherapy, and lack of progression on imaging \u2013 the risk of recurrence within the next 9 months remains lower than if the patient had not received adjuvant therapy or had more advanced disease.

Oxaliplatin: Oxaliplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: timeline1.txt] included in your

antineoplastic antimetabolite that is metabolized to fluorouracil when administered by rapid injection. Floxuridine is available as a sterile, nonpyrogenic, lyophilized powder for reconstitution. When administered by slow, continuous, intra-arterial infusion, it is converted to floxuridine monophosphate. It has been used to treat hepatic metastases of gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and for palliation in malignant neoplasms of the liver and gastrointestinal tract.\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nUridine: nan\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0022916-T01-IM6\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0022916\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Colorectal Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Rectum\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Rectal Adenocarcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT468\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 777, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 30.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"READ\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

This study aims to evaluate the results of resection of rectal cancer in the patients with stage IV disease and to analyze the factors that might affect the survival of these patients. METHODS: Of the 744 patients with radical resection of primary rectal and rectosigmoid cancer during the study period from August 1993 to July 2002, 70 had stage IV disease on the initial presentation. The demographics, the operative details, the tumor characteristics, the postoperative outcomes and survival of the patients were collected prospectively. Factors influencing the survival were analyzed with univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Fifty-three men and 17 women with a median age of 66 years (range: 31-90 years) were included. The median level of the tumor from the anal verge was 10 cm (range 3-20 cm). The operations included abdominoperineal resection (n = 5), anterior resection (n = 53), and Hartmanns operation (n = 11). The operation mortality was 4.3%. The overall morbidity was 42.7% while the surgical morbidity and the reoperation rates were 15.7% and 5%, respectively. The local recurrence rate was 4.3% and the 2-year actuarial rate was 7.8%. All the patients who had local recurrences also had disseminated peritoneal metastasis. The median cancer-specific survival of the patients who survived the surgery was 15.2 months. Multivariate analysis showed that the presence of gross residual local disease, lymph node metastasis, liver involvement of over 50%, the absence of surgical management of liver metastasis and those without chemotherapy were independent factors associated with poor survival. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative mortality and morbidity were acceptable in patients with stage IV rectal cancer. The local disease can be controlled effectively with radical resection. However, in patients with extensive liver involvement and advanced local disease, resection is not worthwhile because of the poor survival. Surgical management of the metastasis and the administration of chemotherapy are associated with better survival. However, the optional treatment regimes are yet to be defined.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 33487580\nTitle: No benefit after neoadjuvant chemoradiation in stage IV rectal cancer: A propensity score-matched analysis on a real-world population.\nAuthors: Milito P, Sorrentino L, Pietrantonio F\nJournal: Digestive and liver disease : official journal of the Italian Society of Gastroenterology and the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver\nPublication Date: 2021 Aug\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Stage IV rectal cancer occurs in 25% of patients and locoregional control of primary tumor is usually poorly considered, since priority is the treatment of metastatic disease. AIMS: This study evaluates impact of neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery (nCHRTS) vs. upfront surgery on locoregional control and overall survival in stage IV rectal cancer. METHODS: All patients diagnosed with stage IV rectal carcinoma between 2009 and 2019, undergone elective surgery at the National Cancer Institute of Milan (Italy), were included. Propensity score-based matching was performed between the two study groups. Loco-regional recurrence-free survival (LRRFS) and overall survival (OS) were analysed using Kaplan-Meyer method. RESULTS: A total of 139 patients were analyzed. After propensity score matching, 88 patients were included in the final analysis. The 3-yr LRRFS rates were 80.3% for nCHRTS vs. 90.4% for upfront surgery patients (p\u202f=\u202f0.35). The 3-yr OS rates were respectively 81.8% vs. 58% (p\u202f=\u202f0.36). KRAS mutation (HR 2.506, p\u202f=\u202f0.038) and extra-liver metastases (HR 4.308, p\u202f=\u202f0.003) were both predictive of worse OS in univariate analysis. CONCLUSION: The present study failed to demonstrate a significant impact of nCHRTS on LRRFS or OS in stage IV rectal cancer.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 34081292\nTitle: Short-course radiotherapy in stage IV rectal cancer with resectable disease.\nAuthors: Cambray M, Gonzalez-Viguera J, Macia M\nJournal: Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico\nPublication Date: 2021 Dec\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION: Stage IV rectal cancer with resectable disease presents challenging issues, as the radical treatment of the whole disease is difficult. Surgery and chemotherapy (CT) play an unquestionable role, but the contribution of pelvic radiotherapy (RT) is not very clear. METHODS: In 2009, we established a prospective treatment protocol that included CT, short-course preoperative radiotherapy (SCRT) with surgery of the primary tumour and all metastatic locations. RESULTS: Forty patients were included. Eight (20%) patients did not receive CT due to significant comorbidities. Radical surgery treatment was possible in 22 (55%) patients. The mean follow-up was 42.81 months (3.63-105.97). Overall survival at 24 and 36 months was 71.4% and 58.2%, respectively. There was good local control of the disease, as 97.2% of pelvic surgeries were R0 and there were no local recurrences. CONCLUSION: In stage IV with resectable metastatic disease, the proposed therapeutic regimen seems very appropriate in well selected patients able to tolerate the treatment. We bet on the role of pelvic RT, due to the good local control of the disease in our series.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nUridine: nan\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

Cetuximab can prolong survival by 8.2 months in RAS wild-type (WT) mCRC patients. Unfortunately, resistance to targeted therapy impairs clinical use and efficiency. The mechanisms of resistance refer to intrinsic and extrinsic alterations of tumours. Multiple therapeutic strategies have been investigated extensively to overcome resistance to anti-EGFR mAbs. The intrinsic mechanisms include EGFR ligand overexpression, EGFR alteration, RAS/RAF/PI3K gene mutations, ERBB2/MET/IGF-1R activation, metabolic remodelling, microsatellite instability and autophagy. For intrinsic mechanisms, therapies mainly cover the following: new EGFR-targeted inhibitors, a combination of multitargeted inhibitors, and metabolic regulators. In addition, new cytotoxic drugs and small molecule compounds increase the efficiency of cetuximab. Extrinsic alterations mainly disrupt the tumour microenvironment, specifically immune cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and angiogenesis. The directions include the modification or activation of immune cells and suppression of CAFs and anti-VEGFR agents. In this review, we focus on the mechanisms of resistance to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies (anti-EGFR mAbs) and discuss diverse approaches to reverse resistance to this therapy in hopes of identifying more mCRC treatment possibilities.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 36844139\nTitle: Resistance to targeted therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer: Current status and new developments.\nAuthors: Tang YL, Li DD, Duan JY\nJournal: World journal of gastroenterology\nPublication Date: 2023 Feb 14\nAbstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most lethal and common malignancies in the world. Chemotherapy has been the conventional treatment for metastatic CRC (mCRC) patients. However, the effects of chemotherapy have been unsatisfactory. With the advent of targeted therapy, the survival of patients with CRC have been prolonged. Over the past 20 years, targeted therapy for CRC has achieved substantial progress. However, targeted therapy has the same challenge of drug resistance as chemotherapy. Consequently, exploring the resistance mechanism and finding strategies to address the resistance to targeted therapy, along with searching for novel effective regimens, is a constant challenge in the mCRC treatment, and it is also a hot research topic. In this review, we focus on the current status on resistance to existing targeted therapies in mCRC and discuss future developments.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 32474402\nTitle: Resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor in metastatic colorectal cancer: What does still need to be addressed?\nAuthors: Martini G, Ciardiello D, Vitiello PP\nJournal: Cancer treatment reviews\nPublication Date: 2020 Jun\nAbstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents a global health problem, being one of the most diagnosed and aggressive tumors. Cetuximab and panitumumab monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in combination with chemotherapy are an effective strategy for patients with RAS Wild Type (WT) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). However, tumors are often unresponsive or develop resistance. In the last years, molecular alterations in principal oncogenes (RAS, BRAF, PI3KCA, PTEN) in the downstream pathway of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and in other receptors (HER2, MET) that converge on MAPK-ERK signalling have been identified as novel mechanisms of resistance to anti-EGFR strategies. However, further efforts are needed to better stratify CRCs and ensure more individualized treatments. Herein, we describe the consolidated molecular drivers of resistance and the therapeutic strategies available so far, with an overview on potential biomarkers of response that could be integrated in clinical practice.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

        "content": "The PubMed search results reinforce the high likelihood of disease progression. These articles consistently highlight the issue of treatment resistance in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Key takeaways include:\n\n*   **Inevitability of Resistance:** Resistance to targeted therapies (like those the patient received \u2013 fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and potentially others previously) is a major clinical challenge in mCRC (Articles #2 & #3).\n*   **Multiple Resistance Mechanisms:** Resistance can develop through various intrinsic (tumor-related) and extrinsic (microenvironment-related) mechanisms (Article #1). These include alterations in EGFR signaling, RAS mutations, and changes in the tumor microenvironment.\n*   **Limited Long-Term Effectiveness:** Even with initial responses, tumors often become resistant, leading to disease progression (Articles #1, #2 & #3).\n\nGiven the patient\u2019s Stage IV disease, the fact that she has already received chemotherapy, and the well-established phenomenon of treatment resistance in mCRC, it is highly probable that the cancer will progress despite any current stability.

Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: timeline1.txt] included in your

Irinotecan- or oxaliplatin-based regimens including biologic agents are known to be effective in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. But in practice, FOLFOX (combination of oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and leucovorin) or FOLFIRI (combination of irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil, and leucovorin) regimens without biologic agents are more commonly used in Korea due to of the high costs of biologic agents. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of FOLFIRI following FOLFOX4 in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. METHODS: A total of 54 patients with advanced colorectal cancer who were treated between May 2005 and May 2013 with FOLFOX4 as first-line chemotherapy and with FOLFIRI as second-line chemotherapy at Kosin University Gospel Hospital (Busan, Korea) were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: A total of 54 patients received second-line FOLFIRI chemotherapy. Five patients (9.3%) had a partial response, 29 patients (53.7%) had a stable disease. The median overall survival was 8.90 months and the median time to progression was 4.33 months. Toxicities were tolerable. CONCLUSIONS: In a Korean population, FOLFIRI as second-line chemotherapy is effective and well tolerated in patients with advanced colorectal cancer after failure of FOLFOX4. Although the efficacy of FOLFIRI in this study was lower than that of second-line FOLFIRI with biologic agents, these results can help in the formulation of a treatment strategy for financially troubled patients.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 12868555\nTitle: Phase II study of irinotecan and mitomycin C in 5-fluorouracil-pretreated patients with advanced colorectal and gastric cancer.\nAuthors: Bamias A, Papamichael D, Syrigos K\nJournal: Journal of chemotherapy (Florence, Italy)\nPublication Date: 2003 Jun\nAbstract: The aim of this phase II study was to investigate the tolerance and efficacy of a second-line irinotecan/mitomycin C combination in patients with advanced gastric or colorectal cancer, pretreated with 5-fluorouracil. Forty patients who had received 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy for advanced disease or adjuvant 5-fluorouracil treatment were enrolled. Chemotherapy consisted of irinotecan 125 mg/m2 and mitomycin C 5 mg/m2, given every 2 weeks. Treatment was continued until progression or limiting toxicity occurred. Five partial responses (12.5%), 22 cases of stable disease (55%) and 13 of progression (32.5%) were registered, giving an overall response rate of 12.5% [95% confidence interval (CI), 4.2-26.8%] and an overall control of tumor growth in 67.5% (95% CI, 50.8-81.4%) of patients. Median progression-free survival was 5 months, median survival time 8 months, and 1-year probability of survival was 21.6%. Diarrhea and neutropenia affected 25% and 12.5% of patients respectively, with only 7.5% experiencing grade 3-4 toxicity. There were no chemotherapy-related deaths or hospitalizations. This combination regimen was shown to be moderately effective with substantially lower toxicity than irinotecan monotherapy in 5-fluorouracil-pretreated patients with advanced gastric or colorectal cancer. It may represent an attractive option in patients at high risk for developing specific irinotecan toxicity.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 12232488\nTitle: Second-Line Treatment of Advanced Colorectal Cancer with a Biweekly Oxaliplatin plus Irinotecan Combination Regimen.\nAuthors: Schull B, Kornek GV, Schmid K\nJournal: Onkologie\nPublication Date: 2002 Aug\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Both oxaliplatin and irinotecan have demonstrated antitumor activity in pretreated colorectal cancer; experimental and early clinical data suggest that these two drugs may act synergistically. The aim of this study was to document the therapeutic index of a biweekly combination regimen in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer failing prior palliative first-line chemotherapy with raltitrexed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study 27 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer were analyzed, who progressed while on or within 6 months after discontinuation of palliative first-line chemotherapy with raltitrexed. They received oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2) and irinotecan 150 mg/m(2) both given on days 1 and 15 every 4 weeks. RESULTS: The confirmed overall response rate was 37% (95% confidence interval, 19.4-57.7%), including 2 complete and 8 partial remissions. 12 additional patients (44.4%) had stable disease, and in only 5 cases (18.5%) disease progression was not influenced by chemotherapy. The median progression-free survival for all 27 patients was 8 months (range, 1-16+ months), and 16 patients (59%) are still alive after a median follow-up time of 12.5 months. Hematologic adverse reactions, specifically leukocytopenia and neutropenia, were common though generally mild to moderate with grade 4 toxicity occurring in only 2 cases. The most frequent non-hematologic adverse events included gastrointestinal symptoms; severe nausea/emesis and diarrhea, however, were noted in only 2 and 3 patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the described biweekly combination regimen of oxaliplatin and irinotecan has substantial antitumor activity in patients with progressive, raltitrexed-pretreated metastatic colorectal cancer. Because of its favorable toxicity profile, further evaluation of this combination seems warranted.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

ng/ml          \n\n[DrugBank: Floxuridine: An antineoplastic antimetabolite that is metabolized to fluorouracil when administered by rapid injection. Floxuridine is available as a sterile, nonpyrogenic, lyophilized powder for reconstitution. When administered by slow, continuous, intra-arterial infusion, it is converted to floxuridine monophosphate. It has been used to treat hepatic metastases of gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and for palliation in malignant neoplasms of the liver and gastrointestinal tract.\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nUridine: nan\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE:

Oxaliplatin: Oxaliplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0022916-T01-IM6\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0022916\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Colorectal Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Rectum\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Rectal Adenocarcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT468\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 777, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 30.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"READ\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

Here's a summary of the key information:\n\n*   **Initial Diagnosis:** Stage 1-3 Rectal Adenocarcinoma, MSS (Microsatellite Stable).\n*   **Initial Treatment:** FOLFOX chemotherapy.\n*   **Progression:** Confirmed liver metastasis at age 57.108, classifying the disease as Stage IV.\n*   **Second-line Treatment:** Floxuridine, Leucovorin, Fluorouracil, and Irinotecan.\n*   **Stable Disease:** From age 57.118 to 59.951 (approximately 2.8 years), CT scans consistently show *no evidence of progression*. CEA levels have remained relatively stable, generally between 1.4 and 2.4 ng/ml.\n*   **Current Age:** 60 years old.\n\nGiven the prolonged period of stable disease (nearly 3 years) after second-line chemotherapy, the patient's prognosis is significantly more favorable than previously estimated. While metastatic colorectal cancer is rarely cured, long-term stable disease is possible in some patients. The fact that the patient has remained stable for this duration suggests a good response to treatment and a relatively slow-growing disease.\n\nI searched PubMed for long-term survival data in metastatic colorectal cancer with stable disease. The results indicate that patients who achieve durable stable disease can have significantly longer survival times than those with progressive disease.\n\nTherefore, considering the prolonged stable disease, I revise my assessment.\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"
