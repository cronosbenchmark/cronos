Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nCapecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers. Capecitabine is a prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to fluorouracil (antimetabolite) in the tumor, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor tissue.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0031600-T01-IM6\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0031600\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Colorectal Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Rectum\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Rectal Adenocarcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT468\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 579, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 70.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"READ\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

However, it progressed again at age 70.450 and 71.014, again to the lung.\n*   **CEA Levels:** CEA levels fluctuated, generally increasing with disease progression and decreasing with periods of stability. The last recorded CEA level (age 71.519) is 2.6 ng/ml.\n*   **Most Recent Scan (Age 71.519):** CT scan shows no evidence of progression.\n\n**Key Findings from Specimen (specimen.txt):**\n\n*   Confirms initial diagnosis of Rectal Adenocarcinoma.\n*   MSS status.\n*   Localized disease at initial diagnosis.\n\n**Analysis and Risk Assessment:**\n\nThe patient initially presented with localized disease but developed metastatic disease to the lung. While there were periods of stability, the cancer has demonstrably progressed. The most recent scan (age 71.519) shows no evidence of progression, which is positive. However, given the history of progression, the patient remains at risk for recurrence.\n\nThe fact that the tumor is MSS is relevant. MSS tumors generally have a lower response rate to immunotherapy compared to MSI-High tumors.\n\nConsidering the patient's history of metastatic disease, the fluctuating CEA levels, and the recent progression, the risk of recurrence within the next 12 months is significant.\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"

Given the patient's age, history of progression, and MSS status, it is unlikely they will survive another 18 months.\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 1103 patients with curatively resected stage II/III rectal cancer who had available polymerase chain reaction-based MSI results were included in the final analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-four (2.2%) patients in the total cohort were found to be MSI-high (MSI-H). In univariate analysis, neither disease-free survival (DFS) nor overall survival (OS) demonstrated significant differences between patients with MSI-H tumors and those with MSI-low (MSI-L) or microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors. The 5-year DFS rate was 78.0% in MSI-H patients and 69.9% in MSI-L/MSS patients (hazard ratio [HR], 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35-2.02; P = .689). The 5-year OS rates for MSI-H and MSI-L/MSS patients were 84.0% and 83.1%, respectively (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.27-2.69; P = .790). By multivariate analysis, the MSI status did not affect either the DFS (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.40-2.47; P = .994) or OS (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.26-2.73; P = .778). CONCLUSIONS: MSI-H tumors are rarely observed in rectal adenocarcinoma, and the MSI status may not affect the survival outcome in patients with a resected rectal cancer.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 34794903\nTitle: Benchmarking Outcomes for Definitive Treatment of Young-Onset, Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer.\nAuthors: Taku N, Yi-Qian YN, Chang GJ\nJournal: Clinical colorectal cancer\nPublication Date: 2022 Mar\nAbstract: PURPOSE: There has been an increase in the incidence of rectal cancer diagnosed in young adults (age < 50 years). We evaluated outcomes among young adults treated with pre-operative long course chemoradiation (CRT) and total mesorectal excision (TME). METHODS: The medical records of 219 patients, age 18-49, with non-metastatic, cT3-4, or cN1-2 rectal adenocarcinoma treated from 2000 to 2017 were reviewed for demographic and treatment characteristics, as well as pathologic and oncologic outcomes. The Kaplan-Meier test, log-rank test, and Cox regression analysis were used to evaluate survival outcomes. RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis was 44 years. CRT followed by TME and post-operative chemotherapy was the most frequent treatment sequence (n = 196), with FOLFOX (n = 115) as the predominant adjuvant chemotherapy. There was no difference in sex, stage, MSS/pMMR, or pCR by age (< 45 years [n = 111] vs. >/= 45 years [n = 108]). The 5-year rates of DFS were 77.2% for all patients, 69.8% for age < 45 years and 84.7% for age >/= 45 years (P = .01). The 5-year rates of OS were 89.6% for all patients, 85.1% for patients with age < 45 years and 94.3% for patients with age >/= 45 years (P = .03). Age >/= 45 years was associated with a lower risk of disease recurrence or death on multivariable Cox regression analysis (HR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.31-0.97, P = .04). CONCLUSION: Among young adults, patients with age < 45 years had lower rates of DFS and OS, compared to those with age >/= 45 years. These outcomes could serve as a benchmark by which to evaluate newer treatment approaches.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 39936724\nTitle: Analysis of clinical and pathological prognostic factors of survival in rectal adenocarcinoma treated with preoperative radiochemotherapy.\nAuthors: Saad SS, Forones N, Lopes Filho G\nJournal: Acta cirurgica brasileira\nPublication Date: 2025\nAbstract: PURPOSE: To identify the prognostic variables related to the survival of patients operated on for adenocarcinoma of the rectum who underwent preoperative radiochemotherapy (RCT). METHODS: We studied 70 patients from the Discipline of Surgical Gastroenterology at Escola Paulista de Medicina from 2000 to 2019, with rectal cancer located up to 10 cm from the anal verge and with stages II or III, submitted to preoperative RCT and curative surgery (R0) and with follow-up of at least 12 months. Clinical restaging was performed four to six weeks after the end of neoadjuvant treatment to characterize the degree of clinical tumor regression. Surgery by laparotomy or videolaparoscopy was performed six to 12 weeks after RCT. Primary endpoint were: overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), metastasis-free survival (MSS), and neoplasm-specific survival (SEN). These were compared with gender, age, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) dosage, distance from the tumor to the anal verge, radiation dose, radiotherapy-surgery interval, clinical regression, type of surgery, pT and pN TNM stage tumor, number of nodes, circumferential resection margin, and complete pathological response. Survival was assessed by Kaplan-Meier curves. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were calculated to identify factors associated with survival outcomes. RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 62 months. The pathological complete response rate was 18.6%. Univariate cox regression showed a significant relationship of CEA equal to or greater than 4 ng/mL with DFS and MFS, pT3/pT4 staging with DFS, MFS and SEN, pN1/N2 with DFS, MFS and SEN and stages II and III with DFS and MFS. Multivariate regression found that CEA, pT, and pN staging are independent prognostic factors for DFS, MFS, and SEN. CONCLUSION: Carcinoembryonic antigen level prior to radiotherapy, pT staging and pN staging were independent prognostic factors for survival in patients with rectal adenocarcinoma who are treated with preoperative radiochemotherapy.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

        "content": "Okay, I've reviewed the provided PubMed search results. While none of the articles directly address survival rates for *stage 4* MSS rectal cancer specifically, they do provide some relevant context.\n\nHere's a refined assessment, incorporating the PubMed findings:\n\n*   **Article #1:** This study on Stage II/III rectal cancer found no significant survival difference between MSI-H and MSS groups. However, this is *not* stage IV disease, and the survival rates reported (83-84% 5-year OS) are much higher than expected for metastatic disease.\n*   **Article #2:** This study focused on young-onset, locally advanced rectal cancer (not metastatic). It showed age as a prognostic factor, with older patients having better outcomes. However, this is not directly applicable to this patient's situation as it doesn't address metastatic disease.\n*   **Article #3:** This study on Stage II/III rectal cancer undergoing neoadjuvant therapy identified CEA level, pT stage, and pN stage as independent prognostic factors for survival. This is helpful, but again, it's not stage IV disease.\n\nConsidering the patient's progression to metastatic disease (lung), MSS status, age (71.6), and the general prognosis for stage IV colorectal cancer, the likelihood of survival beyond 18 months remains low. While the recent scan showed no *current* progression, the history of progression and the aggressive nature of metastatic disease suggest a high probability of further deterioration.\n\nGiven the limited data specifically addressing stage IV MSS rectal cancer survival, and relying on the general understanding of the disease course, I maintain my previous assessment.\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"
