Better knowledge of the risk of locoregional and distant recurrence, in relation to preoperative treatment, pathological stage, and commonly used risk factors, is needed when deciding on adjuvant therapy and surveillance. METHODS: The Swedish ColoRectal Cancer Registry was used to identify patients diagnosed with rectal adenocarcinoma between 2011 and 2018. Readily available variables, including patient, tumor, and treatment factors were exposures. Cox proportional hazard models were used to identify important risk factors for recurrence and calculate recurrence risks. RESULTS: A total of 9428 curatively resected patients were included and followed for a median of 72 months. Eighteen percent had distal recurrence and 3% had locoregional recurrence at 5 years. Risk factors with major impact on distal recurrence were pT4a (hazard ratio [HR] 5.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.3-8.0), pN2b (HR 3.4, 95% CI 2.7-4.2), tumor deposit (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.5-1.9), lymph node yield (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3-1.8), and tumor level 0-5 cm (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3-1.8). Pathologic stage and number of risk factors identified groups with markedly different recurrence risks in all neoadjuvant treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Readily available risk factors, as a complement to stage, are still valid and robust in all neoadjuvant treatment groups. Tumor deposit is important, while circumferential resection margin might no longer be important with improved oncological treatments and high-quality TME surgery. Tailored surveillance is possible in selected groups using risk stratification based on stage and risk factors.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 32729654\nTitle: Factors influencing recurrence of stage I-III rectal cancer in regional Australia.\nAuthors: Haggstrom L, Kang S, Winn R\nJournal: ANZ journal of surgery\nPublication Date: 2020 Dec\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: As treatments for rectal cancer improve with developments in surgical techniques, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the nature of recurrences are evolving. We used a comprehensive database of a large Australian population with stage I-III rectal adenocarcinoma to identify timing and prognostic significance of recurrences, and factors associated with risk of developing recurrent disease. METHODS: All patients with locoregional rectal cancer treated with curative intent in our health district from 2006 to 2017 were included. Multivariate analysis using Cox regression models were used to identify factors associated with recurrence. RESULTS: A total of 483 patients were included. Recurrence occurred in 117 (24.2%) of 483 patients, being locoregional in 15 (3.1%) patients, distant in 85 patients (17.6%) and both locoregional and distant in 17 (3.5%) patients. Compared to those with locoregional recurrence, those with both locoregional and distant recurrence had worse cancer-specific survival. On univariate analysis, factors associated with recurrence included stage, grade, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgery type and distal tumour location. Factors which remained significant on multivariate analysis included higher grade and stage. CONCLUSION: In the era of multimodality therapy for rectal cancer, recurrences are predominantly distant. Traditional predictors including higher stage, grade and distal tumour location remain independently associated with recurrence, despite current treatment paradigms.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 18618181\nTitle: Intersphincteric resection for very low rectal adenocarcinoma: univariate and multivariate analyses of risk factors for recurrence.\nAuthors: Akasu T, Takawa M, Yamamoto S\nJournal: Annals of surgical oncology\nPublication Date: 2008 Oct\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to analyze the risk factors for local and distant recurrence after intersphincteric resection (ISR) for very low rectal adenocarcinoma. METHODS: One hundred twenty consecutive patients with T1-T3 rectal cancers located 1-5 (median 3) cm from the anal verge underwent ISR. Univariate and multivariate analyses of prospectively recorded clinicopathologic parameters were performed. RESULTS: Fifty patients had disease categorized as stage I, 21 as stage II, 46 as stage III, and 3 as stage IV on the basis of International Union Against Cancer tumor, node, metastasis staging system. Median follow-up time was 3.5 years. The 3-year rates of local and distant recurrence were 6% and 13%, respectively. Univariate analysis of the risk factors for local recurrence revealed pathologic T, pathologic stage, focal dedifferentiation, microscopic resection margins, and preoperative serum CA 19-9 level to be statistically significant. Multivariate analysis showed resection margin, focal dedifferentiation, and serum CA 19-9 level to be independently significant. Univariate analysis of the risk factors for distant recurrence indicated tumor location, combined resection, tumor annularity, pathologic N, lateral pelvic lymph node metastasis, pathologic stage, histologic grade, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, and adjuvant chemotherapy to be significant. Multivariate analysis identified pathologic N, histologic grade, and tumor location to be independently significant. CONCLUSION: Profiles of risk factors for local and distant recurrences after ISR are different. With local recurrence, the resection margin, focal dedifferentiation, and serum CA 19-9 level are important. For distant recurrence, the lymph node status, histologic grade, and tumor location need to be taken into account.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

We reviewed factors affecting survival rate and treatment effectiveness in cancer recurrence after local excision among patients with rectal cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 831 patients was enrolled. Of these, 391 patients were diagnosed with primary rectal cancer and underwent local excision. A retrospective observational study was performed on patients who underwent full-thickness local excision for rectal cancer. RESULTS: The median duration of follow-up was 61 months. The overall recurrence rate was 11.5%. The rate of local recurrence was 5.1%. Five-year overall survival rate among recurrent patients was 66.8%; the rate among patients who underwent salvage operation due to recurrence was 84.7%, compared with 44.2% among patients treated with non-operative management (p<0.001). Multivariate analysis of disease-free survival identified distance from the anal verge (p=0.038) and histologic grade (p=0.047) as factors predicting poor prognosis. Multivariate analysis of overall survival showed that age (p<0.001), serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels (p=0.001), and histologic grade (p=0.013) also affected poor prognosis. In subgroup analysis of patients with recurrence, 25 patients underwent reoperation, while 20 patients did not. For 5-year overall survival rate, there was a significant difference between 84.7% of the reoperation group and 44.2% of the non-operation group (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The risk factors affecting overall survival rate after local excision were age 65 years or older, preoperative CEA level 5 or higher, and high histologic grade. In cases of recurrence after local excision of rectal cancer, salvage operation might improve overall survival.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 36697092\nTitle: Pelvic Recurrence After Curative Resection for Rectal Adenocarcinoma: Impact of Surgery on Survival.\nAuthors: Ferrari C, Cuniolo L, Mascherini M\nJournal: Anticancer research\nPublication Date: 2023 Feb\nAbstract: BACKGROUND/AIM: Rectal cancer (RC) represents 30% of colon cancers. Despite the progress achieved in integrated chemoradiotherapy and surgical multidisciplinary treatments, the rate of local recurrence (LR) is 3.7-13%. Multivisceral resections allow many patients with pelvic recurrence to be treated in a curative manner. The purpose of this work is to assess the impact of surgery for rectal cancer patients with pelvic recurrence. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a retrospective study from 2013 to 2018, data was collected from patients who had undergone rectal resection for adenocarcinoma. We compared perioperative data, postoperative outcomes, oncological results, and survival rates. RESULTS: 106 rectal cancer patients (40-87 years old) requiring surgery were included. The local recurrence rate was 15% (15 patients). LR patients requiring intervention were nine (56%) who underwent sphincter sparing surgeries, and 6 (44%) who underwent surgeries with sphincter resection. There was no statistically significant difference (p=0.416) in the 5-year overall survival rate of patients without recurrence compared to those with pelvic recurrence. CONCLUSION: Curative surgery for local recurrence from rectal cancer is safe and feasible and should be considered in selected cases as it seems to provide acceptable surgical and oncological outcomes.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 21590450\nTitle: Recurrence rates and prognostic factors in ypN0 rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiation and total mesorectal excision.\nAuthors: Govindarajan A, Reidy D, Weiser MR\nJournal: Annals of surgical oncology\nPublication Date: 2011 Dec\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy is typically recommended for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. Patients with pathologically node-negative tumors have an improved prognosis, but recurrence patterns and independent prognostic factors in these patients have been incompletely characterized. METHODS: Using a retrospective cohort study design, we included all rectal cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation and curative surgery from 1993 through 2003, who had ypN0 tumors. We characterized recurrence rates and patterns in patients not treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. Secondarily, we compared them to patients who did receive adjuvant treatment and assessed for independent prognostic factors, using univariate and multivariable survival analyses. RESULTS: Overall, 324 ypN0 patients (ypT0: n = 73; ypT1-2: n = 130; ypT3-4: n = 120) were followed for a median of 5.8 years. The risk of recurrence was associated with pathologic stage-2.7% ypT0, 12.3% ypT1-2, 24.2%ypT3-4. Five-year recurrence-free survival in patients who did not receive adjuvant treatment was 100% (ypT0), 84.4% (ypT1-2) and 75% (ypT3-4). There was no significant difference in 5-year recurrence-free survival between patients who did and did not receive adjuvant treatment. In multivariable analysis, pathologic stage was the factor most strongly associated with recurrence (hazard ratio 3.6 for ypT3-4 vs. ypT0-2, 95% confidence interval 1.9-6.7, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The recurrence rates for selected patients with ypT0-2N0 rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiation and total mesorectal excision are low. Although standard practice remains completion of planned postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for all patients undergoing chemoradiation, these data suggest prospective trials may be warranted to measure the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in favorable subgroups, such as ypT0-2N0.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

It shows excellent 5-year recurrence-free survival rates, particularly in ypT0-2 tumors (100%, 84.4%, and 75% respectively).\n\nConsidering the patient's history of *no progression* on CT scans for over 5 years, and extrapolating from the literature, the prognosis is favorable. While recurrence is always a possibility, the prolonged period without evidence of disease significantly increases the likelihood of continued survival. Article #2 is particularly relevant, suggesting that even if recurrence *were* to occur, survival isn't necessarily compromised.\n\nGiven the strong evidence of continued remission and the generally good prognosis for patients with no recurrence after 5 years, I believe the patient is likely to be alive in the next 12 months.\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"

We discuss the implications of our findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An analysis was performed of a prospectively organised data base of 1118 patients treated at our institution by radical prostatectomy after the introduction of PSA in 1987. A strict definition of PSA progression was used, that is any elevation above undetectable PSA or lowest recorded post-operative PSA (nadir), in order not to miss a single patient who may have recurrent local disease or distant metastases without PSA progression. We counted local recurrent disease as those patients having histologically proven adenocarcinoma on TRUS directed biopsies, and distant disease as those patients having detectable metastatic disease on radionuclide bone scan. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 4.0 years (3 months to 15 years). 524 men (46.9%) had a follow-up of more than 5 years and 88 men (7.9%) of more than 10 years. A total of 397 men (35.5%) had biochemical progression according to our strict definition. 53 patients (4.7%) developed a histological local recurrence and 57 men (5.1%) developed bony metastases; none of these men had an undetectable PSA or a stable PSA at nadir level at the time of detection. They all demonstrated a rising PSA. CONCLUSIONS: DRE is no longer necessary in the routine follow-up of patients with an undetectable PSA after radical prostatectomy. Following a period of approximately 2 years of out-patient clinic follow-up post-operatively in which issues such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction are addressed and treated, it is possible to restrict follow-up to PSA determinations alone and as long as the PSA remains undetectable counselling can be carried out by a nurse practitioner.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 22459726\nTitle: Aspects of survival from colorectal cancer in Denmark.\nAuthors: Iversen LH\nJournal: Danish medical journal\nPublication Date: 2012 Apr\nAbstract: This thesis has reported survival among Danish colorectal cancer patients over the past decades and it has explored different aspects of the inferior short-term and long-term survival of Danish patients in relation to (i) patient factors: old age and comorbidity; (ii) disease factors: prognostic factors for early death after emergency surgery; (iii) diagnostic factors: impact of diagnostic delay; (iv) treatment factors: seasonal variation in postoperative mortality and the benefit of a new approach for management of obstructive cancer; and (v) structural factors: hospital volume and surgeon characteristics. Short-term survival. For colonic cancer, the 30-day relative survival rose from 86% in 1977-1982 to 90% in 1995-1999, and for rectal cancer it rose from 90% to 94% (I). Data from regional hospital discharge registries show that the overall 30-day mortality rates of colonic and rectal cancer remained stable at about 11% and 4-5%, respectively, during 1985-2004 (II). Stratifying for urgency of surgery, but not for tumour site, the 30-day mortality rate was 6.2% after elective surgery and 22.1% after emergency surgery in the period 2001-2008 according to DCCG data (17). Nevertheless, the 30-day mortality was about twice as high in Denmark as in Norway, Sweden and Scotland, even if the data for these countries are older than the Danish data. Mortality rates after palliative surgery are three times higher than the rates following curative surgery (115). The stage distribution at the time of diagnosis is more unfavourable in Denmark than in the other Nordic countries (114). Comparison of survival among countries is, however, encumbered by several methodological issues related to completeness, and data quality of cancer registries, among others, biases the survival estimates. Like most western populations, the Danish population is ageing and the proportion of elderly colorectal cancer patients aged >75 years has therefore risen from 37% in 1977-1982 to 42% in 1995-1999 (III). Disparity in cancer treatment between elderly and younger patients exists on a number of counts, e.g., the former's curative resection rate is lower, their emergency presentation rate is higher and they are moreover more likely to present with later-stage disease than are younger patients. However, in Denmark the curative resection rate among elderly patients aged >75 years rose from 36% in 1977-1982 to 49% in 1995-1999 (III). This trend was paralleled by an increase in 30-day and 6-month relative survival. Patients aged >70 years have a 30-day mortality rate of 13.1%, but their younger counterparts' mortality rate is only 3.5% (17). A mortality rate at least two to three times higher among the elderly than among younger patients has been reported repeatedly in various populations (95,96,116,127,128,130,131,135,136,144,145). In Denmark there is an inverse relationship between the comorbidity level and the resection rate in colorectal cancer. In the period 1995-2006, surgical treatment of patients with colonic cancer and severe comorbidity became progressively more aggressive, whereas surgical treatment of patients with rectal cancer apparently became more cautious or differentiated (VI). Nevertheless, the overall 30-day mortality rate after resectional surgery remained stable at about 8% in colonic cancer and at about 6% in rectal cancer. Almost every fourth patient had severe comorbidity as determined by an ASA of III or more and their 30-day mortality rate was at least 18% in 2001-2008. Any reduction in their short-term mortality will therefore have a substantial impact on the overall mortality rate. Despite the impact of comorbidity on postoperative mortality, the distinct seasonal variation seen in mortality from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, with excess mortality in the winter months, has not been observed in postoperative mortality from colorectal cancer (VII). Postoperative mortality from colonic cancer was non-significantly higher in July than in other months of the year (VII). Evidence reveals a volume-outcome relationship regarding postoperative mortality in colonic cancer (IV) and the most recent literature suggests that it probably also is so in rectal cancer. However, volume may be a surrogate marker or proxy for other important structural factors such as quality and capacity of intensive care units, the availability of other clinical services like cardiac care units, multiple medical specialties, multidisciplinary infrastructure and nurse staffing, etc. Postoperative mortality after emergency surgery for colonic cancer was as high as 22% in 2001-2005 and mortality was significantly associated with the postoperative course. Patients developing medical complications had a mortality rate of 57.8%. Independent risk factors for death within 30 days after surgery were age >/= 71 years, male gender, ASA grade >/= III, palliative outcome, free or iatrogenic tumour perforation, splenectomy, intraoperative surgical adverse events and postoperative medical complications (VIII). SEMS placement performed on the indication acute bowel obstruction in patients with potentially curable disease can be accomplished with high technical and clinical success rates. The perforation rate, however, may reach 12%. Even so, the mortality rate within 30 days after a SEMS attempt and later surgery may, irrespective of its timing, by very low (3%) relative to the mortality seen after emergency surgery (IX). Long-term survival. The 5-year relative survival improved by 9% for both colonic and rectal cancer from 1977-1982 to 1995-1999 (I). Further improvement has been observed and in 2004-2006, the 5-year relative survival from colonic cancer was 52% (95% CI 51-54) for men and 57% (95% CI 55-58) for women. For rectal cancer the corresponding percentages were 55% (95% CI 53-57) and 57% (95% CI 55-59) (202). Overall, from 1977 until 2006, 1-year and 5-year survival increased almost 0.5-1% annually. Long-term survival has improved more in rectal cancer than in colonic cancer and survival from rectal cancer surpassed that of colonic cancer in the 2000s (202,204). Elderly patients aged >75 years experienced a marked 13-16% increase in relative survival from 1977-1982 to 1995-1999, i.e., a period during which the rate of curative surgery increased pronouncedly among the elderly (III). The survival improvement among their younger counterparts in that period only reached 7%. Mortality from colorectal cancer was only excessive in the elderly during the first two years after surgery. In 1995-2006, about 30-43% of colorectal cancer patients had moderate and severe comorbidity as determined by a Charlson Comorbidity score of 1-2 and 3+, respectively. These comorbid patients had a long-term survival inferior to that of patients with no comorbidity. In colonic cancer, the 5-year survival in 1998-2000 was 43% in patients with no comorbidity and only 20% in patients with severe comorbidity. Comorbidity had an even stronger impact in rectal cancer (VI). Evidence repeatedly demonstrates a volume-outcome effect on long-term survival from colonic and rectal cancer with improved survival being significantly associated with increasing hospital caseload and surgeon's education/specialty (V). In addition, the most recent evidence reveals that surgeon caseload may have a stronger impact on long-term survival than hospital volume which reflects the complexity in the interaction between hospital caseload and surgeon caseload. A total therapeutic delay >/= 60 day has been shown to have a negative impact on the long-term survival from rectal cancer, but not from colon cancer, given that stage is an intermediate step in the causal pathway between delay and survival (X). Neither provider delay >/= 60 days, nor hospital delays >/= 30 days or >/= 60 days had any prognostic impact on long-term survival from colorectal cancer. Emergency surgery for colonic cancer is associated with an inferior long-term survival. The 5-year survival after acute curative surgery in Denmark is 39% (16). However, the use of SEMS as bridge to elective curative surgery makes it possible to achieve 3-year survival rates similar to those of 75% seen after elective curative surgery for colonic cancer (IX) - despite an unexpectedly high perforation rate.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

This is a predictor of poor outcome. There are no standardized guidelines for treatment. We reviewed the outcomes of our patients with synchronous rectal liver metastases treated with a curative intent by neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without chemoradiotherapy followed by resection of the primary tumour and then liver metastases. METHOD: Between 2004 and 2012, patients who presented with rectal cancer and synchronous liver metastasis were treated with curative intent with peri-operative systemic chemotherapy as the first line of treatment. Responders to chemotherapy underwent resection of the primary tumour with or without preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by hepatic resection. RESULTS: Fifty-three rectal cancer patients with 152 synchronous liver lesions were identified. After a median follow-up of 29.6 months, the median survival was 41.4 months. Overall survival was 59.0% at 3 years and 39.0% at 5 years. CONCLUSION: Rectal resection before hepatic resection combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with promising clinical outcome. It allows downstaging of liver lesions and removal of the primary tumour before the progression of further micrometastases. Furthermore, patients who do not respond to chemotherapy can be identified and may avoid major surgical intervention.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 28707036\nTitle: Treatment strategies for rectal cancer with synchronous liver metastases: surgical and oncological outcomes with propensity-score analysis.\nAuthors: Salvador-Roses H, Lopez-Ben S, Planellas P\nJournal: Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico\nPublication Date: 2018 Feb\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: The optimal sequence of surgery for rectal cancer (RC) with synchronous liver metastases (SLM) is controversial. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to explore differences between the rectum first (RF) and the liver first strategy (LF) to achieve the complete resection (CR) of both tumors. METHODS: Patients diagnosed of RC with resectable or potentially resectable SLM were included. Data collected prospectively were analyzed with an intention-to-treat perspective, adjusting for between-sample differences (propensity score). The complete resection rate (CRR) was the main outcome variable. RESULTS: During a 5-year period, 23 patients underwent the LF strategy and 24 patients the RF strategy. Median overall survival (OS) was 32 months in the LF group and 41 months in the RF group (p = 0.499), and was 51 and 17 months, respectively, for patients achieving or not achieving CR of both tumors (p < 0.001). CRR's were 65% in liver first group and 63% in rectum first group, (p = 0.846). No between-strategy differences in morbidity or duration of treatment were observed. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the notion that the achievement of CR of RC and SLM should be the goal of oncological treatment. Both RF and LF strategies are feasible and safe, but no between-strategy differences have been found in the CRR.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 20177683\nTitle: Stage IV rectal cancer with liver metastases: is there a benefit to resection of the primary tumor?\nAuthors: Cellini C, Hunt SR, Fleshman JW\nJournal: World journal of surgery\nPublication Date: 2010 May\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Resection of primary and liver lesions is the optimal management of Stage IV rectal cancer with liver metastases. For patients with extensive liver metastases, FOLFOX and FOLFIRI have improved resection rates and survival. We compared survival outcomes in patients with Stage IV rectal cancer with liver metastases undergoing staged or synchronous resection with those undergoing primary rectal resection only or no resection at all. METHODS: Patients with metastatic rectal cancer to liver were identified from a colorectal cancer database from 2002 to 2008. Patients received neoadjuvant chemoradiation and adjuvant FOLFOX or FOLFIRI therapy. The outcomes for patients who underwent synchronous resection, staged resection, resection of rectal tumor only, and no resection with chemotherapy only were compared. Statistical analysis was determined by ANOVA. Survival was determined using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients were identified: 30 synchronous resections, 13 staged resections, 22 primary resection only, and 9 no resection. Median follow-up was 23 months (range = 4-58 months). Sixty-five percent of patients underwent liver resection with 26% rendered eligible for resection after adjuvant therapy. Those who underwent primary resection only had shorter median survival than those who underwent either staged or synchronous liver resection (31 vs. 47 vs. 46 months, respectively; P = 0.17). Survival was no different for synchronous versus staged resection (P = 0.6). Volume of liver disease predicted resectability (P = 0.001). Without liver resection, 2-year survival was approximately 60%. Palliative surgery was required in six of nine patients who did not undergo resection of their primary tumor. CONCLUSIONS: Current chemotherapeutic regimens lead to improved survival in patients with unresectable liver metastases. Upfront chemotherapy in the asymptomatic patient compared with resection of the primary tumor does not appear to significantly affect survival. However, given that 60% of patients were alive after 2 years, resection of the primary lesion for palliative reasons and local control must be considered.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
