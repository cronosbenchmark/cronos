We evaluated its clinical impact on prognosis in stage I patients, including minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: 919 patients underwent surgery for lung adenocarcinoma between 2012 and 2019. Stage I patients (n = 500) were retrospectively reviewed. They were divided into 4 categories: MIA and 3 new IASLC grades (grades 1-3). Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with recurrence and mortality. Furthermore, we compared the predictability of the IASLC grading system with different models that are based on the clinicopathologic characteristics (baseline model), TNM staging, and predominant histologic pattern. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated for comparison. RESULTS: Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were significantly stratified by the IASLC grading system in patients with stage I adenocarcinoma (P < .001 and P = .003, respectively). In multivariate analyses, IASLC grade 3 was a significant factor for RFS (hazard ratio [HR] 3.18, P < .001) and OS (HR 2.31, P = .013). The AUCs of the new IASLC model were 0.781 for recurrence and 0.770 for mortality, compared with those of the predominant pattern (0.769 for recurrence, 0.747 for death) and TNM staging (0.762 for recurrence, 0.747 for death). CONCLUSION: The IASLC grading system effectively predicted the prognosis of early-stage adenocarcinoma compared with previous models. The IASLC classification appears to improve the current system; therefore, precise pathologic examination for early-stage adenocarcinoma is warranted.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 23096929\nTitle: Thyroid transcription factor-1 expression is an independent predictor of recurrence and correlates with the IASLC/ATS/ERS histologic classification in patients with stage I lung adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Kadota K, Nitadori J, Sarkaria IS\nJournal: Cancer\nPublication Date: 2013 Mar 1\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: In the current study, the authors investigated whether thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) expression is correlated with the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC)/American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) classification and whether it stratifies patients with stage I lung adenocarcinoma with respect to disease recurrence. METHODS: Patients with stage I lung adenocarcinoma were classified according to the IASLC/ATS/ERS classification. Tissue microarrays were constructed and immunostaining for TTF-1 was performed. A total of 452 cases were available for analysis. Tumors were dichotomized based on the intensity of nuclear TTF-1 expression as negative (score of 0) or positive (score of 1-3). The cumulative incidence of recurrence (CIR) was used to estimate disease recurrence probabilities. RESULTS: TTF-1 expression was identified in 92% of patients, including 100% of patients with minimally invasive or lepidic-predominant adenocarcinoma, 94% of patients with acinar-predominant adenocarcinoma, 98% of patients with papillary-predominant adenocarcinoma, 93% of patients with micropapillary-predominant adenocarcinoma, 86% of patients with solid-predominant adenocarcinoma, 67% of patients with colloid-predominant adenocarcinoma, and 47% of patients with invasive mucinous carcinoma. The CIR for patients with negative TTF-1 expression (n = 34 patients; 5-year CIR, 40%) was significantly higher than that for patients with positive TTF-1 expression (n = 418 patients; 5-year CIR, 15%) (P < .001). Among the patients with intermediate-grade tumors, the CIR for patients with negative TTF-1 expression (n = 16 patients; 5-year CIR, 45%) was significantly higher than that for patients with positive TTF-1 expression (n = 313 patients; 5-year CIR, 14%) (P < .001). On multivariate analysis, negative TTF-1 expression was found to be significantly correlated with an increased risk of disease recurrence (hazards ratio, 2.55; P = .009). CONCLUSIONS: TTF-1 expression was found to be an independent predictor of disease recurrence, stratifying intermediate-grade tumors into 2 prognostic subsets, and it correlates with the IASLC/ATS/ERS classification.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 33593884\nTitle: KRAS (G12C) Mutation Is Associated with Increased Risk of Recurrence in Surgically Resected Lung Adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Jones GD, Caso R, Tan KS\nJournal: Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research\nPublication Date: 2021 May 1\nAbstract: PURPOSE: KRAS (G12C) is the most common KRAS mutation in primary lung adenocarcinoma. Phase I clinical trials have demonstrated encouraging clinical activity of KRAS (G12C) inhibitors in the metastatic setting. We investigated disease-free survival (DFS) and tumor genomic features in patients with surgically resected KRAS (G12C)-mutant lung adenocarcinoma. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients who underwent resection of stage I-III lung adenocarcinoma and next-generation sequencing (NGS) were evaluated. Exclusion criteria were receipt of induction therapy, incomplete resection, and low-quality NGS. Mutations were classified as KRAS wild-type (KRAS (wt)), G12C (KRAS (G12C)), or non-G12C (KRAS (other)). DFS was compared between groups using the log-rank test; factors associated with DFS were assessed using Cox regression. Mutual exclusivity and cooccurrence, tumor clonality, and mutational signatures were assessed. RESULTS: In total, 604 patients were included: 374 KRAS (wt) (62%), 95 KRAS (G12C) (16%), and 135 KRAS (other) (22%). Three-year DFS was not different between KRAS-mutant and KRAS (wt) tumors. However, 3-year DFS was worse in patients with KRAS (G12C) than KRAS (other) tumors (log-rank P = 0.029). KRAS (G12C) tumors had more lymphovascular invasion (51% vs. 37%; P = 0.032) and higher tumor mutation burden [median (interquartile range), 7.0 (5.3-10.8) vs. 6.1 (3.5-9.7); P = 0.021], compared with KRAS (other) tumors. KRAS (G12C) mutation was independently associated with worse DFS on multivariable analysis. Our DFS findings were externally validated in an independent The Cancer Genome Atlas cohort. CONCLUSIONS: KRAS (G12C) mutations are associated with worse DFS after complete resection of stage I-III lung adenocarcinoma. These tumors harbor more aggressive clinicopathologic and genomic features than other KRAS-mutant tumors. We identified a high-risk group for whom KRAS (G12C) inhibitors may be investigated to improve survival.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Here's how they inform my assessment:\n\n*   **IASLC Grading System (Articles 1 & 2):** The new IASLC histologic grading system appears to be a strong predictor of recurrence, even in early-stage disease. Higher grades (especially Grade 3) are associated with significantly worse outcomes. TTF-1 expression (Article 2) also correlates with prognosis, with negative expression indicating a higher risk of recurrence.\n*   **KRAS G12C Mutation (Article 3):**  The KRAS G12C mutation is specifically linked to an increased risk of recurrence after surgical resection, even when controlling for other factors. These tumors also tend to have more aggressive features like lymphovascular invasion and higher tumor mutation burden.\n\nConsidering this new information, and the original data, I still believe the initial assessment of a relatively low risk of immediate recurrence remains reasonable, *but* it's crucial to consider the specific characteristics of this patient's tumor.\n\nThe specimen data indicates the tumor is Bronchiolo-Alveolar Carcinoma, Mucinous, and Stage 1-3.

The majority of cases involves metastasis to more than one other distal organ in addition to the eye. Here, we report for the first time, a case of lung squamous cell carcinoma with solitary symptomatic ocular metastasis as the initial manifestation that was managed by a multidisciplinary treatment (MDT). CASE PRESENTATION: A woman presented at the ophthalmology department of hospital with a 1-week history of left eye pain and blurred vision. Systemic examination led to the diagnosis of central lung cancer in the right lower lobe with ocular metastasis. After consultations with an MDT, including specialists from the surgery, internal medicine, ophthalmology, radiotherapy and imaging departments, the patient underwent surgery and chemotherapy. Her eye symptoms disappeared, and the ocular lesion was well controlled without any specific ocular treatment. The patient demonstrated a prolonged progression-free survival. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of a rare case with solitary ocular metastasis as the initial manifestation of lung squamous cell carcinoma. This rare patient was treated based on evidence-based medicine, indicating the importance of cooperation within an MDT. The successful treatment of this case was reported as a new therapeutic reference for clinicians who encounter similar cases in the future.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

        "content": "The PubMed search result, while describing an interesting case of lung cancer with ocular metastasis, doesn't directly address the question of progression risk following chemotherapy with *indeterminate* findings on imaging. It focuses on a rare presentation and successful treatment of a different type of lung cancer (squamous cell carcinoma) and doesn't provide guidance on interpreting indeterminate results.\n\nHowever, the fact that the initial MRI showed *indeterminate* progression remains the most significant factor in this case. \"Indeterminate\" means that the imaging findings are not clearly indicative of either stable disease or progression. This warrants further investigation and close monitoring. In clinical practice, an indeterminate finding typically leads to a repeat scan in a shorter timeframe (e.g., 3 months) to assess for definitive changes.\n\nGiven the indeterminate MRI result, the lack of follow-up data, and the inherent risk of recurrence in lung adenocarcinoma, I maintain my previous assessment.

We observed a few patients who developed disease progression late, at 5 years or more, after SBRT. In this report, we describe the characteristics of those patients with late recurrence after SBRT. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent SBRT for non-small cell lung cancer with histological confirmation between January 1999 and December 2005 at our institution. During this period, 48 Gy of SBRT in four fractions at the isocenter was prescribed for all patients. RESULTS: In total, 66 patients were eligible. With a median follow-up period of 35.9 months, the 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 44.6% (95% confidence interval, 33.5-59.5%) and 33.8% (95% confidence interval, 23.6-48.4%), respectively. Of the patients, 16 survived without disease progression for 5 years or more after SBRT. Of these, four patients developed late recurrence at 76, 101, 108, and 109 months after SBRT. Three of the patients were females with adenocarcinomas; the other was a male with squamous cell carcinoma. The initial sites of recurrence were local in two patients, distant in one, and simultaneously local and distant in one. A total of two patients with local recurrence alone were still alive at 138 months after SBRT. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of late recurrence was not negligible in long-term survivors after SBRT.

Many reports have described the clinical effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), supporting their utility as a promising therapy that will achieve prominent effects even in patients resistant to cytotoxic anticancer drugs or gene-targeting therapy. ICIs may also prolong overall survival. We analyzed 10 cases of advanced lung cancer targeted with nivolumab, which is one of ICIs in our hospital and reviewed the literature regarding ICIs. We retrospectively analyzed 10 cases that consisted of 6 males and 4 females, which comprised 7 adenocarcinomas, 2 squamous cell carcinomas and one pleomorphic carcinoma. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase mutations were negative in all the adenocarcinoma cases. The 10 analyzed cases included 9 inoperable cases and 1 postoperative recurrent case, 8 second-line cases, a third-line case, and a fourth-line case. The average frequency of administrations of nivolumab was 7.4 times. The survival rate was calculated by using the Kaplan-Meier method. The clinical responses to nivolumab were partial response in 2 cases, stable disease in 4 cases, and progressive disease in 4 cases. In the 10 cases, the response rate and disease control rate were 20% and 60%, respectively. The median progression-free survival time and median survival time were 115 days and 126 days, respectively. We observed 2 cases of dermatitis and one each of pyrexia, general fatigue and drug-induced pneumonia as adverse events (AEs). One of these AEs was severe (Stevens-Johnson syndrome grade 4) but could be treated by steroid pulse therapy, steroid ointment and instillation. Among the 10 examined cases of advanced lung cancer treated with ICIs at our hospital, ICIs proved effective in 2 cases. However, we also experienced a case with Stevens-Johnson syndrome grade 4 as a severe AE. These findings suggest that while ICIs may be effective in treating patients, candidates for ICIs must be carefully selected and cautiously observed.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 34570199\nTitle: Radiological and clinical features of screening-detected pulmonary invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Kim DH, Bae SY, Na KJ\nJournal: Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery\nPublication Date: 2022 Jan 18\nAbstract: OBJECTIVES: The current understanding of pulmonary invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma is largely based on studies of advanced stage patients and data about early-stage invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma are sparse. We evaluated the radiological and clinical features of screening-detected early-stage invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma (SD-IMA). METHODS: Data from 91 patients who underwent surgical treatment for SD-IMA (</=3 cm) from 2013 to 2019 were reviewed retrospectively. Data on radiological characteristics, clinicopathological findings, recurrence and survival were obtained. Disease-free survival rate was analysed. RESULTS: Radiologically, SD-IMAs presented as a pure ground-glass nodule (6.6%), part-solid nodule (38.5%) or solid (54.9%). Dominant locations were both lower lobes (74.7%) and peripheral area (93.4%). The sensitivity of percutaneous needle biopsy was 78.1% (25/32). Lobectomy was performed in 70 (76.9%) patients, and sublobar resection in 21 (23.1%) patients. Seventy-three (80.2%), 15 (16.5%) and 3 (3.3%) patients had pathological stage IA, IB and IIB or above, respectively. Seven patients developed recurrence, and 3 died due to disease progression. Pleural seeding developed exclusively in 2 patients who underwent needle biopsy. The 5-year disease-free survival rate was 89.4%. The disease-free survival rates at 5 years were 86.3% in the lobectomy group and 100% in the sublobar resection group. CONCLUSIONS: SD-IMAs were mostly radiologically invasive nodules. SD-IMAs showed favourable prognosis after surgical treatment.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Treatment efficacy of erlotinib (150mg daily) after progression on gefitinib (250mg daily) was analyzed in patients exhibiting the four clinically favorable factors. Sixteen consecutive female, never smoker, Korean (Asian), adenocarcinoma patients who received erlotinib after gefitinib failure were analyzed. The disease control rate for gefitinib was 68.8% (95% CI, 0.44-0.86) while the disease control rate for erlotinib following gefitinib failure was 25.0% (95% CI, 0.10-0.50) comprised of one partial response and three stable disease patients. The median progression free survival was 6.3 months for gefitinib treatment and 1.7 months for erlotinib treatment following gefitinib failure. The efficacy of erlotinib after progression on gefitinib is unsatisfactory in patients with four favorable clinical factors for TKIs. Novel treatment approaches such as the use of irreversible TKIs or anti-cMET agents for those patients are warranted.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 18423781\nTitle: High efficacy of erlotinib in Taiwanese NSCLC patients in an expanded access program study previously treated with chemotherapy.\nAuthors: Perng RP, Yang CH, Chen YM\nJournal: Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)\nPublication Date: 2008 Oct\nAbstract: PURPOSE: Erlotinib is the first epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) which has demonstrated a survival benefit in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. An open label phase II study was conducted in Taiwanese patients with NSCLC to evaluate its efficacy. METHODS: Patients with proven stage IIIB/IV NSCLC who had received at least one line of standard chemotherapy or radiotherapy were enrolled into this study. All patients were given oral erlotinib, 150mg/day till disease progression. RESULTS: From May 2005 to July 2006, 300 patients were entered from 14 hospitals in Taiwan. This analysis was based on 299 patients who received at least one dose of erlotinib. The best response rates were a 29% partial response and 44% stable disease in 273 patients who had response data available. Non-smoking (p=0.033), adenocarcinoma/BAC (p=0.0027), female (p=0.0013), aged less than 65 years (p=0.0115), stage IV (p=0.0492), patients with skin rash (p=0.0216), and a higher grade of skin rash (p=0.003) were significantly correlated with response to treatment. Skin rash was a common adverse event (any grade: 84%, Gr 3-4: 16%). The median time to disease progression was 5.6 months. Cox regression model for progression free survival showed patients most at risk of early progression were males of low performance status having squamous cell carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: This was the largest multicenter prospective clinical study of NSCLC in Taiwan. The results demonstrated the excellent response rates, time-to-progression and overall survival of erlotinib in a large population of Taiwanese NSCLC patients who had been previously treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 25605210\nTitle: Efficacy and survival-associated factors with gefitinib combined with cisplatin and gemcitabine for advanced non- small cell lung cancer.\nAuthors: Fang H, Lin RY, Sun MX\nJournal: Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP\nPublication Date: 2014\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE: To analyze the efficacy and survival associated factors of gefitinib combined with cisplatin and gemcitabine for advanced non-small cell lung cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 57 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who received platinum-based chemotherapy regimens for more than 1 cycle, were treated with gefitinib combined with cisplatin and gemcitabine until disease progression. Efficacy, survival time and adverse reactions were observed. The Kaplan-Meier method was adopted for analysis of survival and Cox regression for associated influencing factors. RESULTS: The patients were followed up until October 31, 2013, and the median follow-up time was 19 months. Of 57 patients, there were 4 (7.0%) with complete remission (CR), 8 (14.0%) with partial remission, 31 (54.4%) with stable disease, and 14 (24.6%) with disease progression. The remission rate was 21.1% and the disease control rate was 75.4%. The median progression-free survival (PFS) time and the median overall survival time were 10 months and 15.2 months. The one-year, two-year and three- year survival rates were 47.4%, 23.3% and 10.0%. Gender and pathological types were the independent risk factors influencing PFS time (P=0.028, P=0.009). Tumor pathological type and early efficacy were independent factors for the prognosis (P=0.018, P=0.000). Adverse reactions were mostly rashes of I~II degree and diarrhea and slightly increasing level of aminopherase. The skin adverse event incidence of III degree or above was 1.8% (1/57) and brain metastasis was foudn in 31.6% (18/57). CONCLUSIONS: Gefitinib combined with cisplatin andgemcitabine, is effective for patients with IIIb~IV NSCLC who received multiple cycles of chemotherapy.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

The objective was to elucidate the dynamics of prognostic characteristics through conditional survival analysis. METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent complete resection for clinical stage IA part-solid lung adenocarcinoma between 2011 and 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Conditional survival is defined as the probability of surviving further y years, conditional on the patient has already survived x years. The conditional recurrence-free survival (CRFS) and conditional overall survival (COS) were analysed to evaluate prognosis over time, with conditional Cox regression analysis performed to identify time-dependent prognostic factors. RESULTS: A total of 1539 patients were included with a median follow-up duration of 98.4 months, and 80 (5.2%) patients experienced recurrence. Among them, 20 (1.3%) recurrence cases occurred after 5 years of follow-up with 100% intrathoracic recurrence. The 5-year CRFS increased from 95.8% to 97.4%, while the 5-year COS maintained stable. Multivariable Cox analysis revealed that histologic subtype was always an independent prognostic factor for CRFS even after 5 years of follow-up, while the independent prognostic value of consolidation-to-tumour ratio, visceral pleural invasion and lymph node metastasis was observed only within 5 years. Besides, age, pathologic size and lymph node metastasis maintained independent predictive value for COS during long-term follow-up, while consolidation-to-tumour ratio was predictive for COS only within 5 years of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The independent prognostic factors for clinical stage IA part-solid lung adenocarcinoma changed over time, along with gradually increasing 5-year CRFS and stable 5-year COS.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 33552769\nTitle: Maintained Complete Response and Long-Term Survival in Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutated Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer with Erlotinib.\nAuthors: Alkassis S, Alshare B, Ahmed S\nJournal: Cureus\nPublication Date: 2021 Jan 3\nAbstract: The prognosis of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has significantly improved for certain patients with the development of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). However, metastatic NSCLC patients with long-term survival are still rare. Our 66-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital for treatment of pneumonia. A chest CT scan done revealed a left upper lobe mass; computed tomography (CT)-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) was done in 2010 revealing adenocarcinoma. A staging positron emission tomography (PET) scan did not reveal evidence of metastatic disease. He underwent left upper lobectomy and the pathologic stage was IB, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with positive angiolymphatic invasion. He was offered adjuvant systemic therapy, but he opted for surveillance. In 2012, a CT scan showed disease recurrence in the left upper lobe, which was confirmed with a biopsy. He was deemed non-surgical by thoracic oncology. Systemic therapy was initiated with carboplatin/pemetrexed and Avastin; after four cycles of treatment, the CT scan showed stable disease. Mutation analysis sent before chemotherapy revealed EGFR mutation for which chemotherapy was stopped and he was started on switch maintenance with erlotinib 150 mg in October 2012, then the dose was reduced to 100 mg secondary to grades 2-3 acneiform rash. Follow-up CT scans in January 2016 showed complete remission, which is maintained with no evidence of disease as of today. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. Surgical excision is the standard treatment for stage I disease. Despite the long-term survival without adjuvant therapy, the disease recurrence rate ranges between 27% and 38% after resection. Different histologic subtypes vary in pathologic and molecular features, leading to differences in treatment and prognosis. In the adenocarcinoma subtype, five-year progression-free survival in patients with EGFR mutation treated with an EGFR-TKI is 14.6% as compared to less than 5% in unselected patients with distant-stage NSCLC. The association between exon 19 deletions, which represent about 45% of overall EGFR mutations and half of the sensitizing ones, and prolonged survival in patients with advanced NSCLC treated with EGFR-TKIs has been reported by several groups. Our case reports long-term survival in a patient with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC with no evidence of disease for eight years since he started erlotinib treatment. Is there an option to discontinue maintenance erlotinib at this point? The answer to this question is not known, but this is a remarkably maintained response that is a good area to study patient's characteristics leading to differences in response.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 19179899\nTitle: A phase II study of erlotinib as initial treatment for patients with stage IIIB-IV non-small cell lung cancer.\nAuthors: Akerley W, Boucher KM, Bentz JS\nJournal: Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer\nPublication Date: 2009 Feb\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION: Erlotinib improves survival in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who have been previously treated with systemic chemotherapy. The current trial was designed to evaluate erlotinib as a primary therapy before chemotherapy in patients with minimally restricted eligibility criteria. METHODS: Eligibility criteria included stage IIIB/IV or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer, no prior chemotherapy for systemic disease, performance status = 0 to 1, no history of brain metastases, and weight loss less than 10%. Patients received erlotinib 150 mg/d until objective or symptomatic progression when they were offered conventional chemotherapy. The primary end point was progression-free survival. RESULTS: Forty patients were accrued. The median age was 65 years, 35 had performance status = 1, 8 were never-smoker, and 23 were former smokers. Histologies were adenocarcinoma in 22 and squamous cell in six. The major toxicity was rash (grade 1, 12; grade 2, 16; grade 3, 3). Partial responses were observed in six (15%), stable in 11 (28%), and progressive disease in 23 (58%). The median time on erlotinib was 8 weeks. The median survival was 50 weeks with 1, 2, and 3 years survivals of 44%, 18%, and 16%. Retrospective epidermal growth factor receptor mutational analysis was performed in 18 subjects and four mutations (22%) were identified. Only 25 patients have received subsequent chemotherapy (too early, 4; refused, 9; and unable because of performance status, 2), and, of these, 9 (36%) achieved unconfirmed responses. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a modest response rate, lack of enrichment for never-smokers and absence of conventional chemotherapy in many patients, the median and long-term survivals were comparable with those expected after conventional sequencing of chemotherapy. Erlotinib as initial therapy was well tolerated and warrants randomized evaluation as first-line treatment for advanced lung cancer.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 33 patients with recurrent NSCLC treated with re-irradiation plus regional hyperthermia were retrospectively analyzed. The median total dose of initial radiotherapy and re-irradiation were 70 Gy and 50 Gy, respectively. A median of 5 hyperthermia treatments using an 8-MHz radiofrequency-capacitive device were applied during re-irradiation in all patients. RESULTS: Toxicity of Grade 3 was seen in 3 (9%) patients, and no Grade 4 or 5 toxicity was observed. The median overall survival, local control, and disease progression-free survival times after re-irradiation were 18.1, 12.1, and 6.7 months, respectively. Eight patients achieved a long-term survival (more than 3 years after re-irradiation), and 4 of them underwent a third round of irradiation for re-recurrent tumors. Univariate analyses showed that a smaller tumor size (<4 cm) and the absence of distant metastases were significant predictors for a better overall survival. The absence of distant metastases was also found to be a significant predictor for better disease progression-free survival in the univariate analyses. In the subset analyses of 23 patients treated with hyperthermia using electrodes of 30 cm in diameter, the use of a higher radiofrequency-output power tended to be associated with a better prognosis in terms of the local control rate. CONCLUSIONS: Re-irradiation plus regional hyperthermia for recurrent NSCLC appears feasible, with acceptable toxicity, and may be a promising treatment that can result in the long-term survival of patients without distant metastasis and larger recurrent tumors.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 28888381\nTitle: Long-term Observation of CT-guided Radiofrequency Ablation of Lung Neoplasm in 476 Consecutive Patients by a Thoracic Surgical Service: A Single-institutional Experience.\nAuthors: Huang BY, Zhou JJ, Yu ZQ\nJournal: Academic radiology\nPublication Date: 2017 Dec\nAbstract: RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate the overall survival (OS) rate, progression survival rate, and local control rate over 10 years of medically inoperable patients with lung cancer undergoing computed tomography (CT)-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between September 2004 to March 2016, 668 neoplasms were treated in 476 medically inoperable patients (294 men, 60 women; median age 74 years; range 29-84) who underwent CT-guided RFA. All patients had clinical or pathologic evidence of the neoplastic lesion: 22.1% patients with primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 22.3% patients with recurrent NSCLC, 45.2% with metastases, and 10.3% with small cell lung cancer. The mean size of the lesions was 3.8 cm (range of 1-16 cm). Twenty-one lesions were re-treated from one to as many as four times. RESULTS: The procedure was technically successful in all cases. No procedure-related deaths occurred in the RFA procedures. Major complications consisted in 104 (21.8%) cases of low-grade fever, 46 (9.6%) of the pneumothorax. The mean follow-up was 32 months. The probabilities of 1-, 2-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year OS rate were 98.1%, 86.6%, 68.9% 34.5%, and 9.5% for primary NSCLC; 59.7%, 18.5%, 8%, 3.4%, and 1.5% for metastases; 93.3%, 59.1%, 49.6%, 19.7%, and 0% for recurrence; and 89.4%, 67.5%, 39.1%, 16.5%, and 0% for small cell lung cancer. In primary NSCLC, progression-free survival (PFS) and OS were significantly related to tumor size, but there was no significant difference in recurrent NSCLC, metastasis, and peripheral SCLC. The median OS of metastases of NSCLC was significantly related to nodal or distant metastases. The most common pattern of recurrence was local; any type of recurrence at 1-year follow-up imaging was seen in 7.1% of primary NSCLC diameter less than 3 cm. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience indicates that CT-guided RFA done by the thoracic surgeons is feasible and safe in high-risk patients. Maximum tumor diameter less than 3 cm and lack of extrapulmonary metastasis are all positive prognostic factors of survival after RFA. RFA offers good local control of recurrent NSCLC, lung metastases, and SCLC, also in the long-term period. RFA should continue to offer an alternative option in medically inoperable patients.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 39355159\nTitle: Long-term treatment results of pembrolizumab monotherapy: reconsideration of immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy.\nAuthors: Sasaki T, Sugawara T, Tabata T\nJournal: Journal of rural medicine : JRM\nPublication Date: 2024 Oct\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE: The extended outcomes of the KEYNOTE-024 study demonstrated a favorable 5-year overall survival (OS) rate of 31.9%.

CONCLUSION: The combination of two-weekly gemcitabine plus paclitaxel was an effective and well-tolerated second-line chemotherapy regimen for advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients previously treated with platinum-containing chemotherapy. Although the most common and dose limiting toxicities were neutropenia and neuropathy, this regimen was tolerated well by the patients.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 23884779\nTitle: Is thyroid cancer recurrence risk increased after transplantation?\nAuthors: Tisset H, Kamar N, Faugeron I\nJournal: The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism\nPublication Date: 2013 Oct\nAbstract: CONTEXT: An increased cancer mortality is reported in transplanted patients. OBJECTIVE: This multicentric study aimed to investigate the rate of thyroid cancer recurrence after transplantation. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients (35 male/33 female) with a history of both thyroid cancer and organ transplantation were recruited via two nationwide French networks. Histological analysis identified 58 papillary (88%), 5 follicular (7.5%), and 3 poorly differentiated cancer cases (4.5 %). Thirty-one patients (52%) presented high recurrence risk tumors. In the 36 patients with thyroid cancer diagnosed after transplantation, the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 74.7% (SE: 7.3%). One patient died after progression of a poorly differentiated cancer. Persistent disease was observed in six high-risk patients. One of them underwent a second transplantation and disease remained stable after 5 years of follow-up. Thyroid cancer had been diagnosed before transplantation in 32 patients. One patient with cystic fibrosis and thyroid lung metastases at the time of lung transplantation underwent a 4-year remission. For the 31 patients in remission at the time of transplantation, the 5-year DFS was 93.1% (SE: 4.8%). Two patients with local recurrence presented subsequent remission. For the entire study population, the 5-year and 9-year DFS were 81.9% (SE: 5.5%) and 75.6% (SE: 7.9%), respectively. Recurrence or persistent disease occurred in patients with high-risk tumors. CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of thyroid cancer does not seem to be altered by transplantation. This suggests that a history of thyroid cancer should not be considered a contraindication.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

        "content": "The PubMed search results are unfortunately not directly relevant to the question of recurrence risk in lung adenocarcinoma after a period of stable disease. Article 1 focuses on second-line chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC, and Article 2 concerns thyroid cancer recurrence after transplantation.\n\nGiven the lack of specific data from the search, I must rely on my internal knowledge and the patient\u2019s clinical history. The patient has demonstrated prolonged stable disease (over 3.5 years) following an initial recurrence. This is a positive sign, suggesting a relatively low risk of *imminent* recurrence. However, the prior recurrence indicates that the cancer has the potential to return.\n\nThe risk of recurrence is never zero in lung adenocarcinoma, even after prolonged periods of stability. Factors that could increase the risk include the absence of information regarding EGFR mutation status and PD-L1 expression, which could influence treatment options and long-term control.\n\nConsidering the available information, I believe the risk of recurrence within the next 12 months is moderate, but not overwhelmingly high.\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"
