Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0006687-T01-IM5\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0006687\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Colorectal Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Sigmoid Colon\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Colon Adenocarcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT410\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 1390, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 20.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"COAD\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

Progression was noted on CT scan at 53.947. Subsequent CT scans at 54.495 showed no progression.\n*   **Performance Status:** ECOG performance status fluctuated between 0 and 1.\n\n**Key Findings from `specimen.txt`:**\n\n*   Confirms diagnosis of Colon Adenocarcinoma.\n*   Stage IV disease.\n*   MSS status.\n*   Tumor purity is relatively low at 20%.\n\n**Assessment of Recurrence Risk:**\n\nThe patient has Stage IV disease at diagnosis, which carries a higher risk of recurrence. The fact that the CT scan showed progression at 53.947 is concerning. However, the most recent CT scan (54.495) shows no progression. The CEA levels are relatively stable and within a normal range, which is a positive sign. MSS status is generally associated with a lower response to immunotherapy but doesn't directly dictate recurrence risk.\n\nGiven the stage IV diagnosis and the initial evidence of progression, the risk of recurrence within the next 12 months is significant. However, the recent stability on imaging and CEA levels suggest the treatment may be controlling the disease for now.

To establish optimal surveillance guidelines, an understanding of the temporal risk factors for recurrence is necessary. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of our study was to determine predictors for early (within 1 year), middle (1-2 years), and late (2 years or later) recurrence following curative resection in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer. DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study. SETTINGS: The study was conducted at multiple institutions. PATIENTS: The retrospective cohort study comprised 1070 patients with stage IV colorectal cancer after an R0 resection for the primary and metastatic lesions in 19 institutions from January 1997 to December 2007. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk factors for early, middle, and late recurrence were determined by logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: The overall recurrence rate was 73% (784/1070). Cancer-specific survival was 29.5 months, and recurrence-free survival was 8.9 months. Early recurrence occurred in 488 (62%), middle recurrence in 184 (24%), and late recurrence in 112 (14%). In multivariable analysis, early recurrence risk factors included rectum site, depth of tumor invasion (T4), increasing N-staging, venous invasion, and liver metastasis. Late recurrence risk factors were tumor size </=50 mm, and peritoneal dissemination. LIMITATIONS: Because of the retrospective nature of this study, postoperative therapy was not standardized. CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors differ for early, middle, and late recurrences of stage IV colorectal cancer following curative resection. Early (within 1 year) recurrence factors were rectum site, T4, N-staging, venous invasion, and liver metastasis, whereas late (2 years or later) recurrence risk factors were small tumor size and peritoneal dissemination. Our study provides important data to guide a surveillance protocol following stage IV colorectal cancer curative resection.

This study undertakes a comprehensive analysis of the risk factors influencing postoperative recurrence in patients with middle- to late-stage colon cancer and subsequently develops a columnar graphical prediction model based on these findings. This model seeks to enhance the capability of identifying the risk of postoperative recurrence in patients with intermediate and advanced colon cancer, thereby providing a scientific foundation for the development of more personalized and effective prevention and management strategies. METHODS: An analysis was conducted on a cohort of 209 patients diagnosed with colon cancer and treated at our hospital between 2020 and 2021. Clinical data were gathered to compare recurrence rates of postoperative colon cancer among patients with different influencing factors. Logistic regression analysis was utilized to determine independent factors affecting the recurrence rate of postoperative colon cancer. A nomogram risk prediction model was developed and assessed for its effectiveness. RESULTS: The results of the regression analysis indicated that \"Tumor stage\" (stage IV), \"Lymph node metastasis\" (presence), \"the level of C-reactive protein\", and \"the level of carcinoembryonic antigen\" were identified as independent risk factors for postoperative colon cancer recurrence in patients. Additionally, \"Differentiation degree\" (medium/high), \"Chemotherapy (have)\", and \"the level of serum albumin\" were found to be associated with a decreased risk of recurrence. A nomogram prediction model was created using the mentioned risk factors, showing a link between higher scores and higher postoperative colon cancer recurrence rates. The model had a C-index of 0.834 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.776-0.892] and was internally validated for strong and consistent performance. CONCLUSIONS: This study developed a nomogram prediction model to forecast the recurrence rate of postoperative colon cancer by identifying independent influencing factors. The model demonstrates strong discrimination and consistency, offering valuable guidance in promptly assessing the likelihood of postoperative colon cancer recurrence in patients and implementing timely and effective preventive measures.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 38312911\nTitle: Stage IV and recurrent colorectal cancer cured following multimodal therapy: A case series.\nAuthors: Kurata Y, Imai Y, Hirata A\nJournal: Oncology letters\nPublication Date: 2024 Mar\nAbstract: The treatment strategies for colorectal cancer (CRC) with distant metastasis or metastatic recurrence after resection of the primary tumor are controversial. In the present study, four cases of patients with advanced CRC with distant metastasis who achieved disease-free survival (DFS) for >5 years and were deemed potentially cured were reported. Case 1 was that of a 53-year-old male patient with rectal cancer and liver metastases (pT3N2bM1, pStage IV), and case 2 was that of a 58-year-old female patient with descending colon cancer (pT3N1M1, pStage IV) who had lung metastases at surgery and postoperatively. Both patients achieved DFS for >5 years after simultaneous or staged partial hepatectomy or pneumonectomy followed by chemotherapy. Case 3 was that of a 75-year-old male patient with transverse colon cancer (pT3N1M0, pStage IIIB) and case 4 was that of a 73-year-old male patient with sigmoid colon cancer (pT3N0M0, pStage IIA). These cases developed liver metastases after resection of the primary tumour and were subsequently treated with chemotherapy before or after partial hepatectomy. DFS for >5 years was achieved. All four patients were considered cured. The data revealed that even patients with CRC and distant metastases can potentially be cured following multidisciplinary treatment. In the present case report, the factors that enabled these patients to be considered cured were discussed and the aim was to improve the treatment strategy to cure CRC with distant metastasis or recurrence.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

It identifies risk factors for early recurrence (rectum site, T4, N-staging, venous invasion, liver metastasis) and late recurrence (small tumor size, peritoneal dissemination). This reinforces the high risk of recurrence even after initial treatment.\n*   **Article #2 (Zhang et al., 2024):** This article developed a nomogram to predict recurrence risk. Independent risk factors identified were Stage IV disease, lymph node metastasis, CRP levels, and CEA levels. Factors associated with *decreased* risk included chemotherapy and serum albumin levels.\n*   **Article #3 (Kurata et al., 2024):** This case series demonstrates that *cure* is possible in some Stage IV cases with multimodal therapy, but it's not the typical outcome.\n\n**Re-assessment of Patient Case:**\n\nConsidering the PubMed findings *and* the patient's specific details:\n\n*   **Stage IV Disease:** This is a major risk factor for recurrence, as highlighted in multiple articles.\n*   **Initial Progression:** The documented progression on CT scan at age 53.947 is a concerning sign.\n*   **Recent Stability:** The lack of progression on the most recent CT scan (54.495) and relatively stable CEA levels are positive, suggesting the current treatment may be controlling the disease.\n*   **MSS Status:** While not directly addressed in these articles, MSS status doesn't negate the overall high recurrence risk associated with Stage IV disease.\n*   **Treatment:** The patient received FOLFOX, a standard chemotherapy regimen.\n\nThe articles confirm that Stage IV colorectal cancer has a high recurrence rate. While the patient's recent scans are stable, the initial progression and the inherent aggressiveness of Stage IV disease suggest a significant risk of recurrence within the next 12 months.\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"

Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: timeline1.txt] included in your

indicating that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is important for the survival and proliferation of cancer cells.[A192939,A192837,A192891,A193275] VEGF plays an important role in angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, and tumor growth, which are all factors that contribute to its attractiveness as a therapeutic target for anti-cancer therapies.[A192834,A192888,A192837,A192891,A192894] \r\n\r\nIn 2004, bevacizumab (Avastin) gained FDA approval for specific types of cancer, and became the first antiangiogenic agent introduced to the market.[A193272,A193275] It is a humanized monoclonal IgG antibody, and inhibits angiogenesis by binding and neutralizing VEGF-A.[A192888,A192939] Bevacizumab is generally indicated for use in combination with different chemotherapy regimens which are specific to the type, severity, and stage of cancer.[L12648] Bevacizumab was approved by Health Canada on March 24, 2010 and by the European Commission on April 21, 2021.[L45793,L43130] There are several biosimilars of bevacizumab, such as bevacizumab-awwb, bevacizumab-maly, bevacizumab-adcd, and bevacizumab-tnjn. \r\n\r\nInterestingly, researchers have identified higher VEGF expression in patients with COVID-19, which may contribute to lung pathologies including acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI).[L12699] As such, bevacizumab is being investigated for the treatment of lung complications associated with severe cases of COVID-19.[L12699]\nFloxuridine: An antineoplastic antimetabolite that is metabolized

To establish optimal surveillance guidelines, an understanding of the temporal risk factors for recurrence is necessary. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of our study was to determine predictors for early (within 1 year), middle (1-2 years), and late (2 years or later) recurrence following curative resection in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer. DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study. SETTINGS: The study was conducted at multiple institutions. PATIENTS: The retrospective cohort study comprised 1070 patients with stage IV colorectal cancer after an R0 resection for the primary and metastatic lesions in 19 institutions from January 1997 to December 2007. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk factors for early, middle, and late recurrence were determined by logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: The overall recurrence rate was 73% (784/1070). Cancer-specific survival was 29.5 months, and recurrence-free survival was 8.9 months. Early recurrence occurred in 488 (62%), middle recurrence in 184 (24%), and late recurrence in 112 (14%). In multivariable analysis, early recurrence risk factors included rectum site, depth of tumor invasion (T4), increasing N-staging, venous invasion, and liver metastasis. Late recurrence risk factors were tumor size </=50 mm, and peritoneal dissemination. LIMITATIONS: Because of the retrospective nature of this study, postoperative therapy was not standardized. CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors differ for early, middle, and late recurrences of stage IV colorectal cancer following curative resection. Early (within 1 year) recurrence factors were rectum site, T4, N-staging, venous invasion, and liver metastasis, whereas late (2 years or later) recurrence risk factors were small tumor size and peritoneal dissemination. Our study provides important data to guide a surveillance protocol following stage IV colorectal cancer curative resection.

In the present study, four cases of patients with advanced CRC with distant metastasis who achieved disease-free survival (DFS) for >5 years and were deemed potentially cured were reported. Case 1 was that of a 53-year-old male patient with rectal cancer and liver metastases (pT3N2bM1, pStage IV), and case 2 was that of a 58-year-old female patient with descending colon cancer (pT3N1M1, pStage IV) who had lung metastases at surgery and postoperatively. Both patients achieved DFS for >5 years after simultaneous or staged partial hepatectomy or pneumonectomy followed by chemotherapy. Case 3 was that of a 75-year-old male patient with transverse colon cancer (pT3N1M0, pStage IIIB) and case 4 was that of a 73-year-old male patient with sigmoid colon cancer (pT3N0M0, pStage IIA). These cases developed liver metastases after resection of the primary tumour and were subsequently treated with chemotherapy before or after partial hepatectomy. DFS for >5 years was achieved. All four patients were considered cured. The data revealed that even patients with CRC and distant metastases can potentially be cured following multidisciplinary treatment. In the present case report, the factors that enabled these patients to be considered cured were discussed and the aim was to improve the treatment strategy to cure CRC with distant metastasis or recurrence.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 28512795\nTitle: Influence of primary site on metastatic distribution and survival in stage IV colorectal cancer.\nAuthors: Suthananthan AE, Bhandari M, Platell C\nJournal: ANZ journal of surgery\nPublication Date: 2018 May\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: To assess pattern distribution and prognosis of the three anatomical entities of metastatic colorectal cancer, and influence of treatment of metastases on survival. METHODS: Patients presenting with stage IV colorectal cancer (synchronous group), or who developed metastatic recurrence (metachronous group) after initial curative treatment between January 2005 and August 2015 were reviewed. Right sided (cecum to transverse colon), left sided (splenic flexure to sigmoid colon) and rectal cancers were identified. Distribution of metastases were noted as hepatic, lung or peritoneal. RESULTS: Of 374 patients, 276 were synchronous, 98 were metachronous. Metachronous group had a better 3-year survival (54%, 95% CI: 42-64 versus 33%, 95% CI: 27-39, log rank P = 0.0038). There were equal numbers of right (n = 119), left (n = 115) and rectal cancers (n = 140). Rectal cancers had a higher metastatic recurrence, yet demonstrated better 3-year survival (right colon 45%, 95% CI: 19-67, left colon 49%, 95% CI: 27-68, rectum 59%, 95% CI: 42-72, P = 0.39) due to higher proportions of metachronous patients undergoing treatment for metastases (40 versus 14%). Over half of all organ metastases spread to liver, with equal distribution from all three anatomical groups. Rectal cancers showed highest preponderance for lung metastases. CONCLUSION: Rectal cancers have a higher chance of recurring, with a higher metastatic rate to the lung, yet demonstrate better survival outcomes in metastatic colorectal cancer, reflecting the benefit of intervention for metastases.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Here's an updated assessment:\n\n**Key Takeaways from PubMed Articles:**\n\n*   **Article #1 (Kishiki et al., 2018):** This article focuses on recurrence *after curative resection* and identifying risk factors for early vs. late recurrence. It's less directly relevant to a patient already experiencing recurrence and receiving treatment.\n*   **Article #2 (Kurata et al., 2024):** This is a case series demonstrating that *cure* is possible in some cases of Stage IV and recurrent colorectal cancer with multimodal therapy. This is encouraging, but represents a minority of patients.\n*   **Article #3 (Suthananthan et al., 2018):** This article highlights differences in metastatic patterns and survival based on primary tumor location. It also notes that metachronous (recurrent) disease generally has better survival than synchronous (present at initial diagnosis) disease.\n\n**Re-assessment of Patient Case:**\n\nThe patient has Stage IV disease that *recurred* and is now demonstrating stable disease on treatment (Bevacizumab, Fluorouracil, Leucovorin, and Irinotecan).

However, bevacizumab was approved for use after the AVF2107 trial that included a bolus 5-FU schedule (IFL [irinotecan + 5-FU + leucovorin]). No randomized trials have been published comparing FOLFIRI and FOLFIRI-B. The aim of this review is to pool all published data on the activity and efficacy of FOLFIRI-B as first-line therapy in treating advanced CRC in prospective and retrospective studies. We performed a systematic review, through PubMed and EMBASE, of all prospective and retrospective published studies exploring the efficacy of FOLFIRI-B as first-line chemotherapy in patients with advanced CRC. Pooled estimates of the response rate (RR) and weighted median of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) from all FOLFIRI-B-related studies were calculated. Rates of metastasectomy and bevacizumab-related severe toxicities were reported. A total of 29 studies (8 randomized controlled trials, 1 phase IV trial, 2 phase II trials, 4 observational studies, 4 prospective nonrandomized cohort studies, and 10 retrospective case series) were retrieved for a total of 3502 patients. Overall, the pooled RR (n = 22 publications) was 51.4%. Median PFS and OS (n = 25 and 20 publications) were 10.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.9-12.8) and 23.7 months (95% CI, 18.1-31.6), respectively. The pooled rate of surgical resection of metastases (any site of surgery: n = 7 publications) was 9.3% (range, 3.6%-24%), and rate of liver resections (liver surgery only: n = 7 publications) was 18% (range 8%-25%). Grade 3-4 bevacizumab-related toxicities were also comparable with larger phase III trials. FOLFIRI-B is used worldwide as upfront treatment for stage IV CRC. This indication is confirmed by robust data about RR, PFS, and survival obtained, which this pooled analysis of 29 trials also found. FOLFIRI-B remains 1 of the referent combinations when bevacizumab is considered as first-line therapy.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 23400961\nTitle: FOLFIRI + bevacizumab as second-line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer pretreated with oxaliplatin: a pooled analysis of published trials.\nAuthors: Beretta GD, Petrelli F, Stinco S\nJournal: Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)\nPublication Date: 2013 Mar\nAbstract: Irinotecan and infusional 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy (FOLFIRI) plus bevacizumab (FOLFIRI-B) is one of the most effective treatments of advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). However, this schedule is regarded more extensively as first-line therapy and its efficacy has not been proven in phase III randomised trials in oxaliplatin-pretreated patients. We have performed a systematic review through PubMed and EMBASE, including all prospective and retrospective publications exploring the efficacy of FOLFIRI-B as second-line chemotherapy in advanced CRC patients pretreated with oxaliplatin and not with B. Pooled estimates of the response rates (RR), weighted medians of progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) from all FOLFIRI-B-containing arms were calculated. A total of 11 studies (one randomised phase II trial, two phase II trials, two observational studies, two prospective non-randomised collections, and four retrospective case series) were retrieved giving a total of 435 patients. Overall, the pooled RR (n = 11 publications) was 26 %. Median PFS and OS (n = 11 and 10 publications, respectively) were 8.3 and 17.2 months. FOLFIRI-B is a reasonable and effective option for stage IV CRC pretreated with oxaliplatin and not exposed to B during first-line treatment. Its activity seems better than historical FOLFIRI-based second-line trials.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 32639280\nTitle: Predictive and prognostic value of magnesium serum level in FOLFIRI plus cetuximab or bevacizumab treated patients with stage IV colorectal cancer: results from the FIRE-3 (AIO KRK-0306) study.\nAuthors: Schulz C, Heinemann V, Heinrich K\nJournal: Anti-cancer drugs\nPublication Date: 2020 Sep\nAbstract: Magnesium wasting is a frequent side effect of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-antibody treatment as magnesium-absorption mechanisms are dependent on EGFR signaling. EGFR-inhibition results in decreased renal reabsorption. There is evidence that hypomagnesemia during cetuximab treatment correlates with response. The prognostic role of hypomagnesemia during bevacizumab treatment has not been studied yet. Here, we evaluate the prognostic value of hypomagnesemia in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with FOLFIRI plus cetuximab or bevacizumab as first-line therapy. A total of 391 of 752 patients of the firstline irinotecan study population had magnesium levels measured at baseline and for the first three cycles (6 weeks) of treatment. Of those, 240 had Rat Sarkoma wildtype tumors. Overall hypomagnesemia was more common in the cetuximab compared to the bevacizumab arm (80 vs. 43%, P < 0.005). During therapy, magnesium showed a time-dependent decrease to 80% of baseline in the cetuximab and to 89% in the bevacizumab arm. Whereas magnesium continued to decrease over time in the cetuximab-treated patients, it remained stable in the bevacizumab-treated. Overall response rate (ORR) was associated with higher magnesium at week 6 (20.9 vs. 79.1%, P = 0.041). Bevacizumab-treated patients with magnesium levels below the median value at week 6 had a significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS; 11.7 vs. 9.9 months, P = 0.034; hazard ratio 0.73) and a trend towards longer overall survival (OS) (29.6 vs. 23.2 months, P = 0.089; hazard ratio 0.77). Hypomagnesemia at predefined time points and magnesium nadir had no significant effect on ORR, OS and PFS in the cetuximab arm. Our data show different magnesium kinetics in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab or bevacizumab. For patients treated with cetuximab, hypomagnesemia did not have an impact on response and survival. Hypomagnesemia might have a prognostic value in bevacizumab treatment.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic

great deal of evidence indicating that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is important for the survival and proliferation of cancer cells.[A192939,A192837,A192891,A193275] VEGF plays an important role in angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, and tumor growth, which are all factors that contribute to its attractiveness as a therapeutic target for anti-cancer therapies.[A192834,A192888,A192837,A192891,A192894] \r\n\r\nIn 2004, bevacizumab (Avastin) gained FDA approval for specific types of cancer, and became the first antiangiogenic agent introduced to the market.[A193272,A193275] It is a humanized monoclonal IgG antibody, and inhibits angiogenesis by binding and neutralizing VEGF-A.[A192888,A192939] Bevacizumab is generally indicated for use in combination with different chemotherapy regimens which are specific to the type, severity, and stage of cancer.[L12648] Bevacizumab was approved by Health Canada on March 24, 2010 and by the European Commission on April 21, 2021.[L45793,L43130] There are several biosimilars of bevacizumab, such as bevacizumab-awwb, bevacizumab-maly, bevacizumab-adcd, and bevacizumab-tnjn. \r\n\r\nInterestingly, researchers have identified higher VEGF expression in patients with COVID-19, which may contribute to lung pathologies including acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI).[L12699] As such, bevacizumab is being investigated for the treatment of lung complications associated with severe cases of COVID-19.[L12699]\nFloxuridine: An antineoplastic antimetabolite that is metabolized to fluorouracil when administered by rapid injection. Floxuridine is available as a sterile, nonpyrogenic, lyophilized powder for reconstitution. When administered by slow, continuous, intra-arterial infusion, it is converted to floxuridine monophosphate. It has been used to treat hepatic metastases of gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and for palliation in malignant neoplasms of the liver and gastrointestinal tract.\nOxaliplatin: Oxaliplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nUridine: nan\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE:

Bevacizumab: There is a great deal of evidence indicating that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is important for the survival and proliferation of cancer cells.[A192939,A192837,A192891,A193275] VEGF plays an important role in angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, and tumor growth, which are all factors that contribute to its attractiveness as a therapeutic target for anti-cancer therapies.[A192834,A192888,A192837,A192891,A192894] \r\n\r\nIn 2004, bevacizumab (Avastin) gained FDA approval for specific types of cancer, and became the first antiangiogenic agent introduced to the market.[A193272,A193275] It is a humanized monoclonal IgG antibody, and inhibits angiogenesis by binding and neutralizing VEGF-A.[A192888,A192939] Bevacizumab is generally indicated for use in combination with different chemotherapy regimens which are specific to the type, severity, and stage of cancer.[L12648] Bevacizumab was approved by Health Canada on March 24, 2010 and by the European Commission on April 21, 2021.[L45793,L43130] There are several biosimilars of bevacizumab, such as bevacizumab-awwb, bevacizumab-maly, bevacizumab-adcd, and bevacizumab-tnjn. \r\n\r\nInterestingly, researchers have identified higher VEGF expression in patients with COVID-19, which may contribute to lung pathologies including acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI).[L12699] As such, bevacizumab is being investigated for the treatment of lung complications associated with severe cases of COVID-19.[L12699]\nFloxuridine: An antineoplastic antimetabolite that is metabolized to fluorouracil when administered by rapid injection. Floxuridine is available as a sterile, nonpyrogenic, lyophilized powder for reconstitution. When administered by slow, continuous, intra-arterial infusion, it is converted to floxuridine monophosphate. It has been used to treat hepatic metastases of gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and for palliation in malignant neoplasms of the liver and gastrointestinal tract.\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nUridine: nan\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0006687-T01-IM5\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0006687\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Colorectal Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Sigmoid Colon\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Colon Adenocarcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT410\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 1390, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 20.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"COAD\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

Metastases were noted in the liver, pleura, and lymph nodes.\n*   **Third-Line Treatment:** The patient received fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRI + oxaliplatin) between ages 58.333 and 58.906.\n*   **Investigational Treatment:** The patient then received an investigational treatment around age 58.966.\n*   **Current Status (Age 59.1):** The most recent CT scan (age 59.068) shows stable disease, but with metastases present in the lung, liver, pleura, and lymph nodes. CEA is 75.7 ng/ml.\n\n**Key Findings from `specimen.txt`:**\n\n*   Confirms the initial diagnosis and characteristics of the primary tumor. No new specimen data is available regarding the recurrent disease.\n\n**Re-assessment of Survival Probability:**\n\nThe patient has Stage IV disease with multiple metastases. While there have been periods of stable disease, the cancer has demonstrated progression despite multiple lines of therapy. The current CEA level of 75.7 ng/ml is significantly elevated, indicating active disease. The patient is now receiving investigational treatment, suggesting limited standard treatment options remain.\n\nGiven the disease progression, multiple metastases, and elevated CEA, the probability of survival for another 12 months is significantly reduced. While it's impossible to predict with certainty, the overall prognosis is poor.\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"
