MATERIALS AND METHODS: An institutional database was reviewed retrospectively between 1997 and 2013 (N=570). Eligible patients had pathologically proven N2 disease, and they completed the planned trimodality therapy with curative intent. The hazard rate function and competing risk analysis were used to evaluate the recurrence dynamics. RESULTS: Among the included patients, 76% had single station N2 involvement and 95% had complete resection. The 5-year overall and recurrence-free survival rates were 47% and 29%, respectively. Of the 290 patients who experienced recurrence, 25 (8.4%) experienced loco-regional recurrence, whereas 238 (80.4%) had distant metastases. The hazard rate function for overall recurrence revealed a peak at approximately 8 months after surgery and a marked decline after 2 years. The peak recurrence frequency of distant metastasis differed at each site, with isolated brain metastases exhibiting the earliest peak (6 months) and a narrow recurrence interval (15 months). A histological comparison revealed a higher recurrence hazard rate for adenocarcinoma than for squamous cell carcinoma but similar pattern of recurrences. Patients with complete responses had a lower cumulative incidence rate of recurrence but a slightly earlier peak of recurrence. Nodal responses to induction therapy demonstrated that patents with ypN0 had the lowest recurrence risk, whereas patients with ypN1 and ypN2 had similar hazard rates and cumulative incidence rates of recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: The dynamics of recurrence after trimodality therapy is organ-specific and varies according to pathologic factors. Our finding provides information on selection patients with risk of recurrence and timing of surveillance study.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 38950771\nTitle: Late recurrence of completely resected stage I to IIIA lung adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Fick CN, Dunne EG, Toumbacaris N\nJournal: The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery\nPublication Date: 2025 Feb\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE: Research into the risk factors associated with late recurrence (>2 years after surgery) of lung adenocarcinoma is limited. We investigated the incidence of and clinicopathologic and genomic features associated with late recurrence of resected stage I-IIIA lung adenocarcinoma. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with completely resected pathologic stage I-IIIA lung adenocarcinoma (2010-2019). Patients with a history of lung cancer, neoadjuvant therapy, or mucinous or noninvasive lung adenocarcinoma, or with follow-up of less than 2 years were excluded. Cox and logistic regression modeling were used to compare clinicopathologic variables among patients with no, early (</=2 years), and late recurrence. Comparisons of genomic mutations were corrected for multiple testing. RESULTS: Of the 2349 patients included, 537 developed a recurrence during follow-up. Most recurrences (55% [297/537]) occurred early; 45% (240/537) occurred late. A larger proportion of late recurrences than early recurrences were locoregional (37% vs 29%; P = .047). Patients with late recurrence had more aggressive pathologic features (International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer grade 2 and 3, lymphovascular invasion, visceral pleural invasion) and higher stage than patients without recurrence. Pathologic features were similar between patients with early and late recurrence, except stage IIIA disease was more common in the early cohort. No genomic mutations were associated with late recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Late recurrence of lung adenocarcinoma after resection is more common than previously reported. Patients without disease more than 2 years after surgery who had aggressive pathologic features at the time of resection have an elevated risk of recurrence and may benefit from more aggressive follow-up.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 33022797\nTitle: Ten-year survival after pathologic complete response in rectal adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Sell NM, Qwaider YZ, Goldstone RN\nJournal: Journal of surgical oncology\nPublication Date: 2021 Jan\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Multimodal treatment is the standard of care for rectal adenocarcinoma, with a subset of patients achieving a pathologic complete response (pCR). While pCR is associated with improved overall survival (OS), long-term data on patients with pCR is limited. METHODS: This is a single institution retrospective cohort study of all patients with clinical stages II/III rectal adenocarcinoma who underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy and operative resection (January 1, 2004-December 31, 2017). PCR was defined as no tumor identified in the rectum or associated lymph nodes by final pathology. RESULTS: Of 370 patients in this cohort, 50 had a pCR (13.5%). For pCR patients, 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 92%, 5-year OS was 95%. Twenty-six patients had surgery > 10 years before the study end date, of which 20 had an OS > 10 years (77%) with median OS 12.1 years and 95% alive to date (19/20). Of the 50 pCR patients, there was a single recurrence in the lung at 44.3 months after proctectomy which was surgically resected. CONCLUSION: For patients with rectal adenocarcinoma that undergo neoadjuvant chemoradiation and surgical resection, pCR is associated with excellent long-term DFS and OS. Many patients live greater than 10 years with no evidence of disease recurrence.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Bone metastases can cause significant morbidity, including pain, pathological fractures, spinal cord compression, and hypercalcemia. Treatment strategies for bone metastases include radiation therapy, bisphosphonates, denosumab, and systemic therapy. The prognosis of patients with lung adenocarcinoma and bone metastasis is generally poor, with a median survival of approximately 6-12 months after the diagnosis of bone metastasis. However, recent advances in systemic therapy, such as the development of targeted therapies and immunotherapies, have shown promise in improving outcomes for these patients.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 32842617\nTitle: Prognostic Factors for Bone-Only Metastasis in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.\nAuthors: Oh JY, Park K, Kim SW\nJournal: Clinical oncology (R Coll Radiol)\nPublication Date: 2020 Sep\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Bone-only metastasis (BOM) is a relatively uncommon pattern of metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The prognosis of patients with BOM is variable. We investigated the prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with BOM from NSCLC. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 112 patients with BOM from NSCLC. The median OS was 14.2 months, and the median PFS was 6.1 months. Univariate analysis revealed that performance status, number of bone metastases, and treatment with systemic therapy were significantly associated with OS and PFS. Multivariate analysis showed that performance status and treatment with systemic therapy were independent prognostic factors for OS and PFS. CONCLUSIONS: Performance status and treatment with systemic therapy are important prognostic factors for patients with BOM from NSCLC.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 30688498\nTitle: Outcomes of Patients with Lung Adenocarcinoma and Solitary Bone Metastasis Treated with Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy.\nAuthors: Zaidi U, et al.\nJournal: International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics\nPublication Date: 2018 Feb\nAbstract: PURPOSE: Solitary bone metastasis (SBM) from lung adenocarcinoma is a relatively uncommon presentation. We evaluated the outcomes of patients with lung adenocarcinoma and SBM treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively reviewed 52 patients with lung adenocarcinoma and SBM treated with SBRT. Median follow-up was 24 months. Local control rate was 92%. Median overall survival (OS) was 26 months, and 2-year OS was 68%. Patients with visceral crisis had significantly worse OS compared to those without visceral crisis (11 vs 32 months, P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: SBRT is an effective treatment for patients with lung adenocarcinoma and SBM, providing excellent local control and acceptable OS.\n\nBased on the specimen data and the PUBMED search results, the presence of bone metastasis indicates disease progression. The median survival after bone metastasis is reported to be around 6-12 months, although this can vary depending on treatment and other factors. Given the patient's age and the new finding of bone metastasis, it is likely that the cancer will progress in the next 6 months.\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"
