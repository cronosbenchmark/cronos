Oncology\nPublication Date: 2010 Jan\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: The 21-gene recurrence score assay is prognostic for women with node-negative, oestrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer treated with tamoxifen. A low recurrence score predicts little benefit of chemotherapy. For node-positive breast cancer, we investigated whether the recurrence score was prognostic in women treated with tamoxifen alone and whether it identified those who might not benefit from anthracycline-based chemotherapy, despite higher risks of recurrence. METHODS: The phase 3 trial SWOG-8814 for postmenopausal women with node-positive, oestrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer showed that chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF) before tamoxifen (CAF-T) added survival benefit to treatment with tamoxifen alone. Optional tumour banking yielded specimens for determination of recurrence score by RT-PCR. In this retrospective analysis, we assessed the effect of recurrence score on disease-free survival by treatment group (tamoxifen vs CAF-T) using Cox regression, adjusting for number of positive nodes. FINDINGS: There were 367 specimens (40% of the 927 patients in the tamoxifen and CAF-T groups) with sufficient RNA for analysis (tamoxifen, n=148; CAF-T, n=219). The recurrence score was prognostic in the tamoxifen-alone group (p=0.006; hazard ratio [HR] 2.64, 95% CI 1.33-5.27, for a 50-point difference in recurrence score). There was no benefit of CAF in patients with a low recurrence score (score <18; log-rank p=0.97; HR 1.02, 0.54-1.93), but an improvement in disease-free survival for those with a high recurrence score (score > or =31; log-rank p=0.033; HR 0.59, 0.35-1.01), after adjustment for number of positive nodes. The recurrence score by treatment interaction was significant in the first 5 years (p=0.029), with no additional prediction beyond 5 years (p=0.58), although the cumulative benefit remained at 10 years. Results were similar for overall survival and breast-cancer-specific survival. INTERPRETATION: The recurrence score is prognostic for tamoxifen-treated patients with positive nodes and predicts significant benefit of CAF in tumours with a high recurrence score. A low recurrence score identifies women who might not benefit from anthracycline-based chemotherapy, despite positive nodes.

The addition of ovarian suppression to tamoxifen did not result in significantly lower recurrence rates than those with tamoxifen alone. Here, we report the updated results from the two trials. METHODS: Premenopausal women were randomly assigned to receive 5 years of tamoxifen, tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression, or exemestane plus ovarian suppression in SOFT and to receive tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression or exemestane plus ovarian suppression in TEXT. Randomization was stratified according to the receipt of chemotherapy. RESULTS: In SOFT, the 8-year disease-free survival rate was 78.9% with tamoxifen alone, 83.2% with tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression, and 85.9% with exemestane plus ovarian suppression (P=0.009 for tamoxifen alone vs. tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression). The 8-year rate of overall survival was 91.5% with tamoxifen alone, 93.3% with tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression, and 92.1% with exemestane plus ovarian suppression (P=0.01 for tamoxifen alone vs. tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression); among the women who remained premenopausal after chemotherapy, the rates were 85.1%, 89.4%, and 87.2%, respectively. Among the women with cancers that were negative for HER2 who received chemotherapy, the 8-year rate of distant recurrence with exemestane plus ovarian suppression was lower than the rate with tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression (by 7.0 percentage points in SOFT and by 5.0 percentage points in TEXT). Grade 3 or higher adverse events were reported in 24.6% of the tamoxifen-alone group, 31.0% of the tamoxifen-ovarian suppression group, and 32.3% of the exemestane-ovarian suppression group. CONCLUSIONS: Among premenopausal women with breast cancer, the addition of ovarian suppression to tamoxifen resulted in significantly higher 8-year rates of both disease-free and overall survival than tamoxifen alone. The use of exemestane plus ovarian suppression resulted in even higher rates of freedom from recurrence. The frequency of adverse events was higher in the two groups that received ovarian suppression than in the tamoxifen-alone group.

Nevertheless, some low-risk women will experience a local recurrence, and for them the risk of death increases significantly thereafter. The utility of initiating chemotherapy at the time of local recurrence has not been adequately addressed. The purpose of this study is to identify, in a hospital-based series of patients with early-stage breast cancer who were not treated with chemotherapy, those factors which predict death post local recurrence. METHODS: We identified 135 women who were diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer (node-negative, <5 cm) and who did not receive chemotherapy at diagnosis and who developed a local recurrence. They were diagnosed between 1987 and 2000 and treated at Women's College Hospital. For each patient, we abstracted information on the initial cancer (age at diagnosis, tumour size, tumour grade, ER status, PR status, HER2 status, lympho-vascular invasion, type of surgery, use of radiotherapy, tamoxifen and chemotherapy), the time from initial diagnosis to local recurrence and treatment at recurrence. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the ten-year actuarial risk of breast cancer death post recurrence. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate multivariate hazard ratios for the various factors. RESULTS: Among the 135 women in the cohort, the mean time from initial diagnosis to local recurrence was 7.8 years (range: 0.3 to 22.6 years). A total of 38 of the 135 women (28.1%) died of breast cancer a mean of 5.3 years after experiencing the local recurrence (range: 0.3 to 17 years). The ten-year breast cancer survival post local recurrence was 71% and the 15-year survival was 65%. In a multivariate analysis, it was found that factors that were significantly associated with death after local recurrence were (1) PR-negative status, (2) young age at diagnosis (<40 years) and (3) time to local recurrence less than 2 years. Nine percent of women received chemotherapy at the time of local recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: For breast cancer patients with a low baseline risk of mortality, the risk of death after an isolated local recurrence is substantial. Systemic treatment at the time of local recurrence needs further study.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

However, the recent chemotherapy suggests a potential concern for disease activity, and the lung finding on PET scan warrants continued monitoring.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"

All of these patients visited the outpatient clinic of the Department of Radiology of Kochi Medical School Hospital, with an obvious desire to undertake BCT. During this period, another two patients with the same desire were treated with modified radical mastectomy, because of obviously positive surgical margins in frozen sections obtained at surgery. The percentage of patients treated by BCT was, therefore, 95.1%. All of the patients were females, and their average age was 49.9 years. Thirty-six of these 39 patients underwent lumpectomy, and another three patients with large-sized tumor or suspected extensive intraductal component underwent quadrantectomy or wide local excision. Nineteen of these 39 patients who were over 70 years old or had no clinically detectable axillary lymph node swelling received tangential field radiotherapy to their ipsilateral axillary region instead of axillary dissection. At the end of May 1993, the mean follow-up time was 22.4 months. Until now, one patient (T2N1M0, stage IIB) has died of distant metastases of breast cancer to bone, liver, lung, and brain, and another patient, aged 81, died of pneumonia with no evidence of breast cancer progression. The overall survival rates were, therefore, 100% (30/30), 90.0% (18/20), and 75.0% (6/8) at 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years, respectively. Cause-specific survival rates were 100% (30/30), 94.7% (18/19), and 85.7% (6/7) at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 1878605\nTitle: [Tumor regression as a prognostic factor in breast cancer].\nAuthors: Jacquillat C, Weil M, Borel C\nJournal: Bulletin du cancer\nPublication Date: 1991\nAbstract: Two hundred and fifty evaluable patients with breast cancer entered a protocol combining neoadjuvant and consolidation therapy by vinblastine (V), thiotepa (T), methotrexate (m) and 5-fluorouracil (f) (VTMF) with or without Adriamycin (A) (Doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Colombus, OH USA), and radiation therapy as exclusive locoregional treatment.

It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nMethotrexate: Methotrexate is a folate derivative that inhibits several enzymes responsible for nucleotide synthesis.[A180322] This inhibition leads to suppression of inflammation as well as prevention of cell division.[A180322] Because of these effects, methotrexate is often used to treat inflammation caused by arthritis or to control cell division in neoplastic diseases such as breast cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.[A180322,L7144,L7147,L7150,L7180]\r\n\r\nDue to the toxic effects of methotrexate, it is indicated for treatment of some forms of arthritis and severe psoriasis only if first line treatment has failed or patients are intolerant of those treatments.[L7180]\r\n\r\nMethotrexate was granted FDA approval on 7 December 1953.[L7198]\nTamoxifen: Tamoxifen is a non-steroidal antiestrogen used to treat estrogen receptor positive breast cancers as well as prevent the incidence of breast cancer in high risk populations.[A1025,L7799,L7802] Tamoxifen is used alone or as an adjuvant in these treatments.[L7799,L7802] Tamoxifen may no longer be the preferred treatment for these types of cancers as patients generally have better survival, side effect profiles, and compliance with [anastrozole].[A1026]\r\n\r\nTamoxifen was granted FDA approval on 30 December 1977.[L7799]\nDoxorubicin: Doxorubicin is a cytotoxic anthracycline antibiotic isolated from cultures of Streptomyces peucetius var. caesius along side with daunorubicin, another cytotoxic agent, in 1970.[A1575,A257709,A257614] Although they both have aglyconic and sugar moieties, doxorubicin's side chain terminates with a primary alcohol group compared to the methyl group of daunorubicin.[A257709] Although its detailed molecular mechanisms have yet to be understood, doxorubicin is generally thought to exert its effect through DNA intercalation, which eventually leads to DNA damage and the generation of reactive oxygen species.[A257614] Thanks to its efficacy and broad effect, doxorubicin was approved by the FDA in 1974 to treat a variety of cancer, including but not limited to breast, lung, gastric, ovarian, thyroid, non-Hodgkin\u2019s and Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, multiple myeloma, sarcoma, and pediatric cancers.[A1573,A257614,L45231] However, one of the major side effects of doxorubicin is cardiotoxicity, which excludes patients with poor heart function and requires treatment termination once the maximally tolerated cumulative dose is reached.[A257719]\nPaclitaxel: Paclitaxel is a chemotherapeutic agent marketed under the brand name Taxol among others.

Zoledronic acid: Zoledronic acid, or CGP 42'446,[A203120] is a third generation, nitrogen containing bisphosphonate similar to [ibandronic acid], [minodronic acid], and [risedronic acid].[A203111] Zoledronic acid is used to treat and prevent multiple forms of osteoporosis, hypercalcemia of malignancy, multiple myeloma, bone metastases from solid tumors, and Paget\u2019s disease of bone.[L13712,L13715,L13721] Zoledronic acid was first described in the literature in 1994.[A203120]\r\n\r\nZoledronic acid was granted FDA approval on 20 August 2001.[L13712]\nLetrozole: Letrozole, or CGS 20267, is an oral non-steroidal type II aromatase inhibitor first described in the literature in 1990.[A190543,A1559,L11623,L11626] It is a third generation aromatase inhibitor like [exemestane] and [anastrozole], meaning it does not significantly affect cortisol, aldosterone, and thyroxine.[A190546]\r\n\r\nLetrozole was granted FDA approval on 25 July 1997.[L11623]\nPalbociclib: Palbociclib is a piperazine pyridopyrimidine[A176792] that acts in the cell cycle machinery. It is a second generation cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor[A176798] selected from a group of pyridopyrimidine compounds due to its favorable physical and pharmaceutical properties.[A176810]\r\n\r\nPalbociclib was developed by Pfizer Inc after the discovery that identified the cyclin-dependent kinases as key regulators of cell growth.[L5867] It was originally FDA approved on March 2015 for the treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer and its indications were updated in April 2019 to include male patients based on findings from postmarketing reports and electronic health records demonstrating safety and clinical efficacy.[L4894]\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0022653-T01-IM6\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0022653\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Breast Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Breast\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Breast Invasive Ductal Carcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT468\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 691, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 40.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"IDC\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

Here's a summary of the patient's status as of age 50:\n\n*   **Initial Diagnosis (Age 40.663):** Stage IIB Invasive Ductal Carcinoma, MSS.\n*   **Treatment History (through age 47.1):** Multiple lines of chemotherapy (Doxorubicin/Cyclophosphamide, Paclitaxel, Methotrexate/Fluorouracil/Cyclophosphamide) and Tamoxifen.\n*   **Recent Treatments (ages 47.1 - 50):** Letrozole and Palbociclib (started at age 47.1 and continuing), Zoledronic acid (for bone health, started at age 47.709), and Radiation Therapy (age 47.1-47.279).\n*   **Monitoring (ages 47.1-49.980):** Frequent PET and MR imaging consistently show *no progression* of the cancer. CA 15-3 and CEA levels fluctuate but remain within a relatively stable range (CA 15-3 between 16-34, CEA between 1.3-1.8). ECOG performance status fluctuates between 0 and 1.\n*   **Genomic Profiling (specimen.txt):** The initial tumor sample was profiled with IMPACT468, showing MSS status and a TMB of 4.32.\n\nThe consistent \"no progression\" findings on imaging over the past 24 months (from age 46.5 to 50) are very reassuring. The patient is currently on a targeted therapy regimen (Letrozole and Palbociclib) which is likely contributing to disease control. While CA 15-3 and CEA levels fluctuate, they don't show a clear upward trend indicating progression.\n\nGiven this information, the likelihood of cancer progression in the next 12 months appears to be low.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"

Cyclophosphamide may also cause sterility, birth defects, mutations, and cancer.\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nMethotrexate: Methotrexate is a folate derivative that inhibits several enzymes responsible for nucleotide synthesis.[A180322] This inhibition leads to suppression of inflammation as well as prevention of cell division.[A180322] Because of these effects, methotrexate is often used to treat inflammation caused by arthritis or to control cell division in neoplastic diseases such as breast cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.[A180322,L7144,L7147,L7150,L7180]\r\n\r\nDue to the toxic effects of methotrexate, it is indicated for treatment of some forms of arthritis and severe psoriasis only if first line treatment has failed or patients are intolerant of those treatments.[L7180]\r\n\r\nMethotrexate was granted FDA approval on 7 December 1953.[L7198]\nTamoxifen: Tamoxifen is a non-steroidal antiestrogen used to treat estrogen receptor positive breast cancers as well as prevent the incidence of breast cancer in high risk populations.[A1025,L7799,L7802] Tamoxifen is used alone or as an adjuvant in these treatments.[L7799,L7802] Tamoxifen may no longer be the preferred treatment for these types of cancers as patients generally have better survival, side effect profiles, and compliance with [anastrozole].[A1026]\r\n\r\nTamoxifen was granted FDA approval on 30 December 1977.[L7799]\nDoxorubicin: Doxorubicin is a cytotoxic anthracycline antibiotic isolated from cultures of Streptomyces peucetius var. caesius along side with daunorubicin, another cytotoxic agent, in 1970.[A1575,A257709,A257614] Although they both have aglyconic and sugar moieties, doxorubicin's side chain terminates with a primary alcohol group compared to the methyl group of daunorubicin.[A257709] Although its detailed molecular mechanisms have yet to be understood, doxorubicin is generally thought to exert its effect through DNA intercalation, which eventually leads to DNA damage and the generation of reactive oxygen species.[A257614] Thanks to its efficacy and broad effect, doxorubicin was approved by the FDA in 1974 to treat a variety of cancer, including but not limited to breast, lung, gastric, ovarian, thyroid, non-Hodgkin\u2019s and Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, multiple myeloma, sarcoma, and pediatric cancers.[A1573,A257614,L45231] However, one of the major side effects of doxorubicin is cardiotoxicity, which excludes patients with poor heart function and requires treatment termination once the maximally tolerated cumulative dose is reached.[A257719]\nPaclitaxel: Paclitaxel is a chemotherapeutic agent marketed under the brand name Taxol among others. Used as a treatment for various cancers, paclitaxel is a mitotic inhibitor that was first isolated in 1971 from the bark of the Pacific yew tree which contains endophytic fungi that synthesize paclitaxel. It is available as an intravenous solution for injection and the newer formulation contains albumin-bound paclitaxel marketed under the brand name Abraxane.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract

Zoledronic acid: Zoledronic acid, or CGP 42'446,[A203120] is a third generation, nitrogen containing bisphosphonate similar to [ibandronic acid], [minodronic acid], and [risedronic acid].[A203111] Zoledronic acid is used to treat and prevent multiple forms of osteoporosis, hypercalcemia of malignancy, multiple myeloma, bone metastases from solid tumors, and Paget\u2019s disease of bone.[L13712,L13715,L13721] Zoledronic acid was first described in the literature in 1994.[A203120]\r\n\r\nZoledronic acid was granted FDA approval on 20 August 2001.[L13712]\nLetrozole: Letrozole, or CGS 20267, is an oral non-steroidal type II aromatase inhibitor first described in the literature in 1990.[A190543,A1559,L11623,L11626] It is a third generation aromatase inhibitor like [exemestane] and [anastrozole], meaning it does not significantly affect cortisol, aldosterone, and thyroxine.[A190546]\r\n\r\nLetrozole was granted FDA approval on 25 July 1997.[L11623]\nPalbociclib: Palbociclib is a piperazine pyridopyrimidine[A176792] that acts in the cell cycle machinery. It is a second generation cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor[A176798] selected from a group of pyridopyrimidine compounds due to its favorable physical and pharmaceutical properties.[A176810]\r\n\r\nPalbociclib was developed by Pfizer Inc after the discovery that identified the cyclin-dependent kinases as key regulators of cell growth.[L5867] It was originally FDA approved on March 2015 for the treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer and its indications were updated in April 2019 to include male patients based on findings from postmarketing reports and electronic health records demonstrating safety and clinical efficacy.[L4894]\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0022653-T01-IM6\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0022653\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Breast Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Breast\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Breast Invasive Ductal Carcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT468\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 691, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 40.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"IDC\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).
