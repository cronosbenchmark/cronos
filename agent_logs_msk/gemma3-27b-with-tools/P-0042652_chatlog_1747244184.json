Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nCapecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers. Capecitabine is a prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to fluorouracil (antimetabolite) in the tumor, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor tissue.\nTrametinib: Trametinib is an orally bioavailable mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2 inhibitor.[A258298,A258293] It was first approved by the FDA in May 2013 for the treatment of melanoma.[A258298] It was later approved by Health Canada on July 18, 2013 [L45588] and by the European Commission on June 30, 2014.[L45583] Trametinib is currently approved to treat a variety of cancers with BRAF mutations, such as non-small cell lung cancer and thyroid cancer, as monotherapy or in combination with [dabrafenib], a BRAF inhibitor, for improved therapeutic efficacy. Originally developed by Japan Tobacco, trametinib was initially investigated for treating inflammation, but further studies for this indication were not pursued.[A258298]\nDabrafenib: Dabrafenib mesylate (Tafinlar) is a reversible ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor and targets the MAPK pathway. It was approved on May 29, 2013, for the treatment of melanoma with V600E or V6000K mutation.[L41955] It was also used for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with the same mutation.[L41955]\r\n\r\nIn May 2018, Tafinlar (dabrafenib), in combination with Mekinist ([DB08911]), was approved to treat anaplastic thyroid cancer caused by an abnormal BRAF V600E gene.[L41955]\nNivolumab: Nivolumab is a fully human IgG4 antibody targeting the immune checkpoint programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1).[L12129] This antibody was produced entirely in mice and grafted onto human kappa and IgG4 Fc region with the mutation _S228P_ for additional stability and reduced variability.[A35203] It was developed by Bristol Myers Squibb.[L12129]\r\n\r\nNivolumab was granted FDA approval on 22 December 2014.[L12129] It is also available in combination with [relatlimab] under the brand name Opdualag.[L41265,L49996,L50001]\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

MSS (Microsatellite Stable).\n*   **Treatment:**\n    *   Surgery at age 75.475.\n    *   Nivolumab immunotherapy from age 75.628 to 75.7625.\n    *   Trametinib and Dabrafenib targeted therapy from age 75.842 to 77.1406.\n    *   Capeciatabine and Oxaliplatin chemotherapy from age 77.341 to 77.5324.\n*   **Progression Monitoring:** Multiple CT and PET scans throughout the timeline consistently show \"no progression\" or \"indeterminate progression\" until age 77.398.\n*   **CEA Levels:** CEA levels were measured at 77.152 (7.9000 ng/ml) and 77.360 (1.1000 ng/ml).\n*   **Current Age:** 77.4 years old.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe patient has undergone multiple lines of therapy, including immunotherapy and targeted therapy, suggesting an aggressive approach to treatment. The consistent reports of \"no progression\" on imaging studies are reassuring. However, the initial CEA level of 7.9 ng/ml, while not extremely high, is elevated and then decreases to 1.1 ng/ml after chemotherapy. This could indicate a response to treatment. The patient is currently at 77.4 years old, and the last imaging was at 77.398 showing no progression.\n\nGiven the MSS status, the patient is less likely to respond to immunotherapy long-term compared to MSI-High tumors. The use of targeted therapy (Trametinib/Dabrafenib) suggests the presence of a BRAF mutation, which is a driver mutation in some colorectal cancers.\n\n**Recurrence Risk:**\n\nPredicting recurrence is complex. While the patient has shown no evidence of progression on imaging, the history of cancer and the aggressive treatment regimen indicate a continued risk. The decrease in CEA levels is a positive sign, but ongoing monitoring is crucial.\n\nConsidering the information available, it's difficult to definitively say whether recurrence will occur in the next 12 months. However, given the history of treatment and the potential for late recurrence in colon cancer, I believe there is a possibility of recurrence.\n\n[ANSWER: A]"

Genetic testing showed wild-type KRAS/NRAS/BRAF, HER-2 amplification, and microsatellite stable. Then the patient started to receive fruquintinib and has already achieved a 6-month progression-free survival. Till Jun 2019, the treatment with fruquintinib is still ongoing and no severe adverse effect has been seen so far. Although fruquintinib is not, at present, a standard therapeutic strategy recommended by the treatment guideline for advanced small bowel adenocarcinoma, the significant curative effect has been seen in our clinical practice.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 40103819\nTitle: Case Report: The immune architecture of immunotherapy-induced cutaneous sarcoidosis resembles peritumoral inflammation.\nAuthors: Wang CJ, Strong J, Gatti-Mays ME\nJournal: Frontiers in immunology\nPublication Date: 2025\nAbstract: Avelumab, is an anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI). Like other ICI, avelumab can cause immune-related adverse events. Although rare, sarcoidosis-like granulomatous reactions have been described in patients on anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Here we report a case of treatment emergent cutaneous sarcoidosis in a patient who received avelumab for metastatic colon cancer. A 56-year-old African American woman with metastatic colon cancer that had progressed after multiple lines of treatment, including other immunotherapy agents, was enrolled on a clinical trial with avelumab. While on treatment, the patient developed two skin lesions, and histopathological examination of both biopsies demonstrated chronic granulomatous inflammation in the dermis with multinucleated giant cells containing asteroid bodies, consistent with cutaneous sarcoidosis. Multiplex immunofluorescence revealed parallels between the immune architecture of the patient's cutaneous sarcoidal lesion and an excised tumor metastasis. Recognizing cutaneous sarcoidosis as a rare adverse effect of ICI immunotherapy is important because sarcoidal lesions can be mistaken for metastatic disease on clinical exam and medical imaging. We noticed similar immune composition of the sarcoidal granuloma and tumor microenvironment. However, further studies are needed to fully elucidate the mechanism of ICI associated sarcoidosis.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Both articles are case reports, and while interesting, they don't provide strong generalizable data regarding progression risk in elderly patients with colon adenocarcinoma after multiple lines of therapy. Article #1 focuses on small bowel adenocarcinoma and a specific drug (fruquintinib), and Article #2 discusses an immune-related adverse event. Neither directly addresses the question of progression risk in a patient like ours.\n\nConsidering the information from the `specimen.txt` and `timeline0.txt` files, along with my medical knowledge, here's my assessment:\n\n*   **Patient Characteristics:** 77.4-year-old with sigmoid colon adenocarcinoma, MSS status, and a history of multiple treatment lines (surgery, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, chemotherapy).\n*   **Recent History:** The patient has recently completed chemotherapy (Capeciatabine and Oxaliplatin) with a decrease in CEA levels, and the last imaging (CT scan) at age 77.398 showed no progression.\n*   **MSS Status:** MSS tumors generally have a lower response rate to immunotherapy and a higher risk of recurrence compared to MSI-High tumors.\n*   **Multiple Lines of Therapy:** Having progressed through multiple lines of therapy suggests the cancer is becoming more resistant to treatment.\n*   **Age:** Older patients may have decreased physiological reserves and be less able to tolerate further treatment if progression occurs.\n\nGiven these factors, despite the recent lack of progression on imaging, the patient remains at risk for disease progression. The history of multiple treatments and MSS status suggest a higher likelihood of eventual progression. While the recent chemotherapy may have provided a temporary benefit, the underlying disease is likely still present.\n\nTherefore, I believe the cancer is likely to progress in the next 12 months.\n\n[ANSWER: A]"

Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nCapecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers. Capecitabine is a prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to fluorouracil (antimetabolite) in the tumor, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor tissue.\nTrametinib: Trametinib is an orally bioavailable mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2 inhibitor.[A258298,A258293] It was first approved by the FDA in May 2013 for the treatment of melanoma.[A258298] It was later approved by Health Canada on July 18, 2013 [L45588] and by the European Commission on June 30, 2014.[L45583] Trametinib is currently approved to treat a variety of cancers with BRAF mutations, such as non-small cell lung cancer and thyroid cancer, as monotherapy or in combination with [dabrafenib], a BRAF inhibitor, for improved therapeutic efficacy. Originally developed by Japan Tobacco, trametinib was initially investigated for treating inflammation, but further studies for this indication were not pursued.[A258298]\nDabrafenib: Dabrafenib mesylate (Tafinlar) is a reversible ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor and targets the MAPK pathway. It was approved on May 29, 2013, for the treatment of melanoma with V600E or V6000K mutation.[L41955] It was also used for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with the same mutation.[L41955]\r\n\r\nIn May 2018, Tafinlar (dabrafenib), in combination with Mekinist ([DB08911]), was approved to treat anaplastic thyroid cancer caused by an abnormal BRAF V600E gene.[L41955]\nNivolumab: Nivolumab is a fully human IgG4 antibody targeting the immune checkpoint programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1).[L12129] This antibody was produced entirely in mice and grafted onto human kappa and IgG4 Fc region with the mutation _S228P_ for additional stability and reduced variability.[A35203] It was developed by Bristol Myers Squibb.[L12129]\r\n\r\nNivolumab was granted FDA approval on 22 December 2014.[L12129] It is also available in combination with [relatlimab] under the brand name Opdualag.[L41265,L49996,L50001]\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in

Multiple CT scans confirm this progression.\n*   **Recent Treatments:** The patient received Trametinib/Dabrafenib (stopped at 78.7379) and Nivolumab (stopped at 78.3187). Radiation therapy was administered at age 78.406.\n*   **Performance Status:** The ECOG performance status fluctuated between 0 and 1 during this period.\n*   **CEA Levels:** CEA was 1.8 ng/ml at age 78.661.\n*   **MSS Status:** Remains MSS (from the initial specimen analysis).\n*   **Current Age:** 78.8 years old.\n\n**Analysis & Prognosis:**\n\nThis patient has an aggressive disease course with multiple lines of therapy failing. The development of metastases to the lung and liver indicates advanced disease. While the ECOG performance status is relatively good (0-1), the continued progression despite treatment is concerning. The MSS status limits the effectiveness of immunotherapy.\n\nGiven the patient's age (78.8 years), the extent of disease progression, and the limited treatment options remaining, the prognosis is poor. While it's impossible to predict with certainty, the likelihood of survival for another 12 months is low. The patient is actively progressing despite recent treatments.\n\n[PUBMED: median survival rate metastatic colorectal cancer elderly patients] would be a useful search to confirm this assessment, but given the information at hand, I believe the most likely outcome is that the patient will not be alive in the next 12 months.\n\n[ANSWER: B]"

Forty patients with mCRC aged >/=70 years, initially treated with bevacizumab and capecitabine, were followed from the start of the treatment of metastatic disease to death. Tumor tissue samples were retrospectively analyzed for RAS, BRAF and microsatellite status. After a median follow-up time of 20.5 months, the median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 9.8 and 20.5 months, respectively and the objective response rate (ORR) was 65%. Twelve patients had mutation in RAS and four patients in BRAF gene, which coexisted with MSI in two cases. Patients with the right-sided tumor had apparently, but not statistically significantly lower PFS (8.6 vs. 13 months, P = 0.14) and statistically significantly lower OS (13 vs. 23.1 months, P = 0.046). Twelve patients with one or more postprogression therapy lines had significantly better ORR (12/12 = 100% vs. 14/28 = 50%, P = 0.003), median PFS (17.2 vs. 8.5 months, P < 0.001) and median OS (42 vs. 13 months, P < 0.001) than patients who received just first-line study treatment. Elderly patients with mCRC responded favorably to bevacizumab and capecitabine, especially the subgroup with the left-sided primary tumor. In the further subset of this group, characterized by RAS/BRAF wild-type and MSS tumors, the application of postprogression therapies was feasible and resulted in significant prolongation of survival.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 34380826\nTitle: Survival impact of optimal treatment for elderly patients with colorectal cancer: A real world study.\nAuthors: Akdeniz N, Kucukoner M, Kaplan MA\nJournal: Indian journal of cancer\nPublication Date: 2021 Oct-Dec\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: In this real-life practice study, we aimed to find whether elderly colorectal cancer (CRC) patients in our center were treated optimally and also if this has an effect on overall survival (OS) or not. METHODS: We have retrospectively screened 150 CRC patients older than 65 years, diagnosed in our institution between 2010 and 2018. As study variables, patient characteristics, tumor location, tumor, nodes, metastases stage, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS), comorbidities, adjuvant or metastatic chemotherapy regimens, and treatment toxicity were recorded, and the OS rate of patients was assessed. RESULTS: The median age was 72 (range 65 - 89) years and 48 (32%) patients had metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. The median OS (mOS) in the suboptimal adjuvant treatment group was 31.5 (range 20.7-42.3) months, whereas mOS was not reached during the median follow-up time in the optimal treatment group (P = 0.036). The addition of oxaliplatin to chemotherapy had no benefit on mOS (P = 0.318). In the metastatic setting, the mOS in the optimal and suboptimal treatment group was 27.2 (range 10.7-43.7) months and 13.4 (range 7.5-18.8) months respectively, and was statistically significant (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that optimal treatment had a significant effect on the mOS of elderly CRC patients and it was well tolerated. Advanced age alone is not a sufficient parameter for precluding effective therapy in elderly patients with CRC.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 33249761\nTitle: Trifluridine/tipiracil plus bevacizumab as a first-line treatment for elderly patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (KSCC1602): A multicenter phase II trial.\nAuthors: Oki E, Makiyama A, Miyamoto Y\nJournal: Cancer medicine\nPublication Date: 2021 Jan\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: A previous Phase I/II study demonstrated that TAS-102 (trifluridine/tipiracil [FTD/TPI]) plus bevacizumab (Bev) has encouraging efficacy and controllable safety for patients with previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer. Therefore, we designed for assessing the efficacy and safety of FTD/TPI plus Bev in elderly patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer. METHODS: This is a multicenter, single-arm Phase II study included patients >/=70 years old with previously untreated, unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer. Treatment consisted of FTD/TPI plus Bev given every 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), assuming a null hypothesis of a PFS of 5 months. The secondary endpoints were the overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), and adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: Between 5 January 2017 and 13 March 2018, 39 patients were enrolled from 18 institutions. The median patient age was 76.0 years (range, 70-88); the ECOG-PS was 0 in 24 patients and 1 in 15 patients. The median PFS was 9.4 months as a primary endpoint, and the median OS was 22.4 months. The ORR was 40.5% and the disease control rate was 86.5%. Grade 3-4 AEs included neutropenia (71.8%), leukopenia (51.3%), anorexia (15.4%), febrile neutropenia (10.3%), and fatigue (10.3%). CONCLUSIONS: FTD/TPI plus Bev is an effective and well-tolerated regimen for elderly patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer. Capecitabine/bevacizumab can be selected as a subsequent maintenance therapy without irinotecan and oxaliplatin because FTD/TPI has no cross-resistance with 5-fluorouracil.

        "content": "Okay, I have reviewed the PubMed search results regarding median survival rates in elderly patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Here's a summary of the key findings:\n\n*   **Article 1 (Omrcen et al., 2020):** In elderly patients (>=70 years) treated with bevacizumab and capecitabine as first-line therapy, the median overall survival (OS) was 20.5 months. Patients with right-sided tumors had a statistically significantly lower OS (13 months).\n*   **Article 2 (Akdeniz et al., 2021):** Optimal treatment (defined as adherence to guidelines) was associated with significantly improved OS in elderly CRC patients. In the metastatic setting, mOS was 27.2 months in the optimal treatment group versus 13.4 months in the suboptimal group.\n*   **Article 3 (Oki et al., 2021):** A Phase II trial of trifluridine/tipiracil plus bevacizumab in previously untreated metastatic CRC patients (age >=70) showed a median OS of 22.4 months.\n\n**Re-evaluation of Patient Case:**\n\nConsidering these findings, and the patient's specific situation:\n\n*   **Age:** 78.8 years (within the range studied in these articles).\n*   **Disease Status:** Metastatic disease with progression despite multiple lines of therapy (Nivolumab, Trametinib/Dabrafenib, and recent progression on CT).\n*   **MSS Status:** Remains MSS, which generally correlates with poorer prognosis.\n*   **Recent Progression:** The patient is actively progressing, with new metastases identified.\n\nWhile the studies show median OS ranging from 13.4 to 22.4 months in elderly patients with metastatic CRC, these figures represent patients receiving *initial* treatment for metastatic disease or optimal treatment regimens. This patient has already failed multiple lines of therapy. The recent progression and the MSS status suggest a significantly worse prognosis.\n\nGiven the aggressive nature of the disease, the patient's age, and the failure of prior treatments, it is unlikely the patient will be alive in the next 12 months.\n\n[ANSWER: B]"
