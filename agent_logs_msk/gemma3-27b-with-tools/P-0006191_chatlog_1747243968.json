No clear predictive markers for recurrence of early lung adenocarcinoma are available. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) is rarely used to identify recurrence-related genes. We aimed to identify genetic alterations that can predict recurrence, by comparing the molecular profiles of patient groups with and without recurrence. METHODS: Tissues from 230 patients with resected stage I-II lung adenocarcinoma (median follow-up: 49 months) were analyzed via targeted NGS for 207 cancer-related genes. The recurrence-free survival according to the number and type of mutation was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Independent predictive biomarkers related to recurrence were identified using the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Recurrence was observed in 64 patients (27.8%). In multivariate analysis adjusted for age, sex, smoking history, stage, surgical mode, and visceral pleural invasion, the CTNNB1 mutation and fusion genes (ALK, ROS1, RET) were negative prognostic factors for recurrence in early-stage lung adenocarcinoma (HR 4.47, p = 0.001; HR 2.73, p = 0.009). EGFR mutation was a favorable factor (HR 0.51, p = 0.016), but the CTNNB1/EGFR co-mutations were negative predictors (HR 19.2, p < 0.001). TP53 mutation was a negative predictor compared with EGFR mutation for recurrence (HR 5.24, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Targeted NGS can provide valuable information to predict recurrence and identify patients at high recurrence risk, facilitating selection of the treatment strategy among close monitoring and adjuvant-targeted therapy. Larger datasets are required to validate these findings.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 39574121\nTitle: Dynamically monitoring minimal residual disease using circulating tumour cells to predict the recurrence of early-stage lung adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Zhang Q, Zhang X, Lv Z\nJournal: Journal of hematology & oncology\nPublication Date: 2024 Nov 21\nAbstract: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 19%. With the advent of screening and diagnostic techniques such as low-dose spiral CT and liquid biopsy, the detection rate of early stage LUAD is increasing. Even in stage I LUAD, the cumulative 5-year recurrence rate after radical surgical resection is 17.9%. This may be related to the presence of microscopic residual disease (MRD), a potential source of recurrence and metastasis. Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) are key biomarkers in liquid biopsies, but the ability of dynamic CTC detection to monitor MRD and warn of recurrence in patients with early LUAD has not been validated. Here, we conducted a prospective study using the telomerase reverse transcriptase-based CTC detection method (TBCD) to evaluate perioperative and follow-up CTC levels for dynamic monitoring to evaluate its clinical efficacy in predicting postoperative recurrence in early-stage LUAD. By longitudinal dynamic monitoring of CTC, we accurately predicted recurrence within 2 years after surgery, with an AUC of 0.9786, demonstrating the clinical values of CTC in predicting recurrence. The median lead time from positive detection of CTC to radiological recurrence was 183 days, with the earliest CT recurrence predicted 354 days in advance. Taken together, our study demonstrates that longitudinal monitoring of CTC is effective in early warning of LUAD recurrence and provides valuable information on early detection and intervention strategies for the management of LUAD.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 28702948\nTitle: Pathological prognostic factors of recurrence in early stage lung adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Yi E, Bae MK, Cho S\nJournal: ANZ journal of surgery\nPublication Date: 2018 Apr\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Histological heterogeneity is thought to be important for prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma. We investigated to determine pathological features with prognostic value for recurrence of early stage lung cancer. METHODS: A total of 368 patients who underwent curative surgical resection for early stage lung adenocarcinoma between 2009 and 2012 were enrolled. Pathologic characteristics including the presence of visceral pleural invasion, micropapillary patterns, aerogenous spread, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion and necrosis were examined. The correlations between pathological factors and clinical outcomes were analysed to determine prognostic significance. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 43.0 months (+/-14.56, ranging from 0.0 to 73.9 months). Three-year overall survival was 95.2% and disease-free survival was 89.8%. The recurrence rate was 9.0% (33 patients) and the mortality rate was 6.0% (22 patients). The presence of a micropapillary pattern (P < 0.002), lymphatic invasion (P < 0.000), aerogenous spread (P < 0.000), vascular invasion (P = 0.036) and necrosis (P < 0.000) were negative prognostic factors of recurrence in univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, only aerogenous spread had prognostic value (P = 0.020). The recurrence hazard ratio for the presence of aerogenous spread was 3.2 (95% confidence interval 1.20-8.47). CONCLUSION: The presence of aerogenous spread was an independent pathological risk factor of recurrence in stage I lung adenocarcinoma. Micropapillary pattern had prognostic importance for recurrence in univariate analysis, but not in multivariate analysis.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

According to the 2011 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC), American Thoracic Society (ATS), and European Respiratory Society (ERS) classification and 2015 World Health Organization classification of tumors of the lung, lepidic-predominant adenocarcinomas </= 3 cm in size can be classified as adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), and invasive adenocarcinoma, lepidic predominant. AIS lesions, which are noninvasive, and MIA lesions, which show </= 0.5 cm of invasion, have been recommended to be considered stage pTis (adenocarcinoma) and pT1(mi), respectively. We conducted a systematic analysis of the published data to evaluate the prognostic differences between AIS and MIA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive search of published studies was conducted from the electronic databases using relevant search criteria. Studies that reported outcomes for >/= 8 cases classified as AIS or MIA using the 2011 IASLC/ATS/ERS criteria were selected for the present analysis.

A total of 972 patients were included (429 with AIS and 294 with MIA; 2 studies reported AIS and MIA together, n = 249). The median age was 65.5 years, 63% were female, and 40% were smokers. The 5-year disease-free survival rate for the whole population was 97.9%. The 5-year disease-free survival rate was 100% for AIS and MIA pooled from the studies that reported the 2 groups separately. The 5-year overall survival rate for the entire group was 97.5%, and the 5-year overall survival rate was 100% for AIS and 98.5% for MIA. CONCLUSION: No significant differences were found in the survival rates between patients with lung adenocarcinoma categorized as MIA or AIS. This finding raises questions regarding the evidence for TNM staging of AIS and MIA as recommended by the 2011 IASLC/ATS/ERS and 2015 World Health Organization classification of tumors of the lung and should be reevaluated with further studies.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 38677985\nTitle: Differences in postoperative prognosis between early-stage lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.\nAuthors: Izaki Y, Mimae T, Kagimoto A\nJournal: Japanese journal of clinical oncology\nPublication Date: 2024 Jul 7\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Although prognosis and treatments differ between small-cell- and nonsmall-cell carcinoma, comparisons of the histological types of NSCLC are uncommon. Thus, we investigated the oncological factors associated with the prognosis of early-stage adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. METHODS: We retrospectively compared the clinicopathological backgrounds and postoperative outcomes of patients diagnosed with pathological stage I-IIA adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma primary lung cancer completely resected at our department from January 2007 to December 2017. Multivariable Cox regression analysis for overall survival and recurrence-free survival was performed. RESULTS: The median follow-up duration was 55.2 months. The cohort consisted of 532 adenocarcinoma and 96 squamous cell carcinoma patients. A significant difference in survival was observed between the two groups, with a 5-year overall survival rate of 90% (95% confidence interval 86-92%) for adenocarcinoma and 77% (95% CI 66-85%) for squamous cell carcinoma (P < 0.01) patients. Squamous cell carcinoma patients had worse outcomes compared to adenocarcinoma patients in stage IA disease, but there were no significant differences between the two groups in stage IB or IIA disease. In multivariate analysis, invasion diameter was associated with overall survival in adenocarcinoma (hazard ratio 1.76, 95% confidence interval 1.36-2.28), but there was no such association in squamous cell carcinoma (hazard ratio 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.45-1.14). CONCLUSIONS: The importance of tumor invasion diameter in postoperative outcomes was different between adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Thus, it is important to consider that nonsmall-cell carcinoma may have different prognoses depending on the histological type, even for the same stage.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 34631307\nTitle: A four-gene prognostic signature for predicting the overall survival of patients with lung adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Liu L, He H, Peng Y\nJournal: PeerJ\nPublication Date: 2021\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: The prognosis of patients for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is known to vary widely; the 5-year overall survival rate is just 63% even for the pathological IA stage. Thus, in order to identify high-risk patients and facilitate clinical decision making, it is vital that we identify new prognostic markers that can be used alongside TNM staging to facilitate risk stratification. METHODS: We used mRNA expression from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort to identify a prognostic gene signature and combined this with clinical data to develop a predictive model for the prognosis of patients for lung adenocarcinoma. Kaplan-Meier curves, Lasso regression, and Cox regression, were used to identify specific prognostic genes. The model was assessed via the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) and validated in an independent dataset (GSE50081) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). RESULTS: Our analyses identified a four-gene prognostic signature (CENPH, MYLIP, PITX3, and TRAF3IP3) that was associated with the overall survival of patients with T1-4N0-2M0 in the TCGA dataset. Multivariate regression suggested that the total risk score for the four genes represented an independent prognostic factor for the TCGA and GEO cohorts; the hazard ratio (HR) (high risk group vs low risk group) were 2.34 (p < 0.001) and 2.10 (p = 0.017). Immune infiltration estimations, as determined by an online tool (TIMER2.0) showed that CD4+ T cells were in relative abundance in the high risk group compared to the low risk group in both of the two cohorts (both p < 0.001). We established a composite prognostic model for predicting OS, combined with risk-grouping and clinical factors. The AUCs for 1-, 3-, 5- year OS in the training set were 0.750, 0.737, and 0.719; and were 0.645, 0.766, and 0.725 in the validation set. The calibration curves showed a good match between the predicted probabilities and the actual probabilities. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a four-gene predictive signature which represents an independent prognostic factor and can be used to identify high-risk patients from different TNM stages of LUAD. A new prognostic model that combines a prognostic gene signature with clinical features exhibited better discriminatory ability for OS than traditional TNM staging.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

This study investigated the clinical characteristics, survival and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene (EGFR) mutation status of lung adenocarcinoma patients with MPE. From June 2005 to December 2010, consecutive pleural effusions were collected prospectively. Patient clinical characteristics, EGFR mutation status, and overall survival were analysed. We collected MPEs from 448 patients in stage IV lung adenocarcinoma at initial diagnosis. Median overall survival for patients with MPEs at initial diagnosis and following disease progression were 14.3 months and 21.4 months, respectively (p=0.001). There were 296 (66.1%) patients harbouring EGFR mutations, the mutation rates among patients with an MPE at initial diagnosis and one following disease progression were 68.2% and 56.6%, respectively (p=0.044); the L858R mutation rate was also higher among the former (32.6% versus 18.1%; p=0.009). Multivariate analysis revealed that patients who: developed MPEs following disease progression, harboured EGFR mutations, and received EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, had longer overall survival. Patients in stage IV lung adenocarcinoma with MPEs at initial diagnosis have shorter overall survival and higher EGFR mutation rate, especially for L858R, than patients who develop MPEs following disease progression.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 30312680\nTitle: Survival Comparison in Patients with Stage IV Lung Cancer in Academic versus Community Centers in the United States.\nAuthors: Ramalingam S, Dinan MA, Crawford J\nJournal: Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer\nPublication Date: 2018 Dec\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION: Although metastatic NSCLC is widely treated in both academic centers (ACs) and community-based centers (CCs), it is unclear whether outcomes are similar across both settings. A growing variety of chemotherapies and targeted agents for an increasingly histology- and molecular-based treatment strategy could provide an advantage to patients treated in ACs. Using the National Cancer Database, we investigated whether treatment at ACs was associated with a survival advantage in metastatic NSCLC. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the National Cancer Database after the introduction of novel NSCLC chemotherapy agents from 1998 to 2010. The primary outcome was 2-year survival, which was analyzed by using a multivariable regression model controlling for age, year of diagnosis, sex, primary payer, histologic type, facility type (AC versus CC), and an interaction term allowing a time-based comparison of survival between ACs and CCs. Alpha was set to 0.001 because of the size of the data set. RESULTS: There were 193,279 patients included in this study. The percentage of patients achieving 2-year survival was higher in ACs versus in CCs in 1998 (11.5% versus 9.2% [+2.3%]), and by 2010, the difference had increased to 17.4% versus 13.1% (+4.3%). Multivariable analysis confirmed a significant relative increase in 2-year survival associated with ACs versus with CCs from 1998 to 2010 (p = 0.0005). A histology-dependent survival difference was also noted in adenocarcinoma versus in squamous cell carcinoma (10.2% versus 9.9% in 1998 [+0.3%], increasing to 17.3% versus 10.1% in 2010 [+7.2%]). Adenocarcinoma survival also varied by treatment facility, with the difference in 2-year survival in ACs versus in CCs increasing from 12.3% versus 9.1% (+3.2%) in 1998 to 20.5% versus 15.5% (+5%) in 2010, with a trend toward significance in our multivariable model (p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: A greater increase in survival was noted in ACs than in CCs over this time period, and it was particularly pronounced among patients with adenocarcinoma versus in those with squamous cell carcinoma. Given the known advances in adenocarcinoma treatment compared with in squamous cell lung cancer over this time period, our study suggests that potential treatment-related disparities may exist between ACs and CCs. Further study will be needed to validate this disparity in health care and address opportunities to improve survival in patients with stage IV NSCLC across treatment settings.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 31787547\nTitle: Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Lung Adenocarcinoma Survival: A Competing-Risk Model.\nAuthors: Wu X, Wang Y, Lin X\nJournal: Clinical lung cancer\nPublication Date: 2020 May\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Race/ethnicity-specific disparities in lung cancer survival have been investigated extensively. However, more studies concentrating on lung adenocarcinoma (ADC), especially those using a competing-risk model, are needed. We examined race/ethnicity-specific differences in lung ADC survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with ADC diagnosed from 2004 to 2015 were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. Race/ethnicity was categorized into 4 groups: non-Hispanic white (NHW), non-Hispanic black (NHB), non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander (NHAPI), and Hispanic. Lung cancer-specific mortality (LCSM) and other cause-specific mortality (OCSM) were evaluated using a competing-risk model. RESULTS: On multivariate analysis, NHB patients experienced slightly lower LCSM (subdistribution hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.94-0.98) and higher OCSM (subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-1.22) compared with NHW patients in the stage IV group. No significant differences were found in LCSM and OCSM between the NHB and NHW patients with early-stage ADC (stage I or II). Both NHAPI and Hispanic patients experienced lower OCSM and LCSM compared with the NHW patients. Additionally, NHB patients with stage IV tumors had a greater mortality risk of cardiovascular disease and a lower risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease than NHW patients. CONCLUSIONS: The source of racial/ethnic survival disparities that exist between NHB and NHW patients was mainly found in patients with stage IV ADC. Reducing the greater mortality rate of cardiovascular disease among NHB patients and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease among NHW patients would be conducive to narrowing the racial/ethnic gaps. Further research is warranted to determine additional influencing factors, especially among patients with stage IV ADC.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
