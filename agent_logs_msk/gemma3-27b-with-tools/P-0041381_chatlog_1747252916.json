In an attempt to enhance this goal, we started a regimen of treatment consisting of preoperative radiation therapy (PRT), 45 Gy in 5 weeks, followed by surgery 4-6 weeks after termination of the PRT. Depending on the local characteristics of the tumor, either an abdominoperineal resection (APR), a posterior pelvic exenteration (PPE), and a total pelvic exenteration (TPE) were performed. All patients found with distant metastasis were excluded from this study. There were 66 patients: 40 males and 26 females. Fifty six underwent an APR, six a PPE, and four a TPE. Their median age was 56 years. Major complications were intraoperative bleeding (15%); perineal wound infection (21%); abdominal wound infection (9%). Five patients (7.5%) died within 30 days of surgery; two after APR, two after PPE and one after TPE. Median follow-up is 60 months. The overall local recurrence rate is 9.8%. Recurrences related to the Astler-Coller modification of Dukes' stage were 0/21 in A or B1, but 6/40 (15%) when the stages were B2, B3, C1, C2 and C3. In conclusion, we found this treatment approach effective in obtaining local control of the rectal adenocarcinoma and comparable to the results of other series.

The aim of this study was to identify the different prognostic factors affecting the recurrence of adenocarcinoma of the rectum. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients operated for adenocarcinoma of the rectum between January 2000 and December 2015 was conducted. The study of the recurrence rate and prognostic factors was performed through the Kaplan Meier survival curve and the Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: During the study period, 188 patients underwent curative surgery for rectal adenocarcinoma, among which 53 had a recurrence. The recurrence rate was 44.6% at 5 years. The multivariate analysis identified four parameters independently associated with the risk of recurrence after curative surgery: a distal margin </= 2 cm (HR = 6.8, 95% CI 2.7-16.6, 6), extracapsular invasion of lymph node metastasis (HR = 4.4, 95% CI 1.3-14), tumor stenosis (HR = 4.3, 95% CI 1.2-15.2), and parietal invasion (pT3/T4 disease) (HR = 3, 95% CI 1.1-9.4). CONCLUSION: The determination of the prognostic factors affecting the recurrence of rectal adenocarcinoma after curative surgery allows us to define the high-risk patients for recurrence.

STUDY DESIGN: One hundred eight consecutive patients with T1-T3 rectal cancers located 1 to 5 cm (median 3 cm) from the anal verge underwent ISR. A retrospective analysis of prospectively recorded data from the 106 patients not receiving radiotherapy was performed. RESULTS: There were 23 T1, 40 T2, and 43 T3 tumors. Morbidity and mortality rates were 33% and 1%, respectively. The 3-year rates of overall local recurrence and survival were 5.7% and 95%, respectively. The 3-year cumulative local recurrence rate was 0% for the patients with T1-T2 tumors as compared with 15% for those with T3 tumors (p=0.0012). In T3 tumors, the 2-year local recurrence rate was 5% for patients with negative surgical margins as compared with 33% for those with positive margins (p=0.0001). The incidences of distant recurrence for stages I, II, III, and IV disease were 4%, 5%, 18%, and 33%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: ISR does not increase local or distant recurrences. For T1-T2 tumors, meticulous dissection and irrigation after closure of the distal stump allows local control without radiotherapy. With T3 tumors, preoperative therapy should be considered if resection margins are estimated to be insufficient.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

(1992):** Local recurrence rate of 9.8% after preoperative radiation therapy and surgery. This study is older and includes patients who received radiation, which isn't directly applicable to this case.\n*   **Farhat et al. (2019):** 5-year recurrence rate of 44.6%. Identified distal margin (<2cm), extracapsular invasion, tumor stenosis, and T3/T4 disease as independent risk factors.\n*   **Akasu et al. (2007):** 3-year local recurrence rate of 5.7% after intersphincteric resection. Recurrence was significantly higher in T3 tumors (15%) compared to T1-T2 tumors (0%). Positive surgical margins also increased recurrence risk in T3 tumors.\n\nConsidering this information *in conjunction* with the patient's timeline, here's my updated assessment:\n\nThe timeline doesn't provide the original staging (TNM stage) of the cancer. However, the fact that multiple CT scans showed \"no progression\" and eventually \"no cancer\" is highly encouraging. The patient *did* receive chemotherapy, which reduces the risk of recurrence. The initial PET scan showing involvement in \"Other\" locations is a concern, but the subsequent CT scans don't show evidence of disease in those areas.\n\nThe Farhat et al. study shows a relatively high 5-year recurrence rate (44.6%), but this includes patients with various risk factors. The Akasu et al. study highlights the importance of T stage and margin status. Without knowing the patient's specific stage and margin status, it's difficult to provide a precise recurrence risk.\n\nHowever, given the negative CT scans and chemotherapy treatment, the risk of recurrence within the next 12 months appears to be lower than the overall recurrence rates reported in the literature.\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"

Methods: A descriptive case series study was carried out. Clinical data of patients with locally advanced low rectal cancer (LALRC) who achieved complete clinical response (cCR) or nearly cCR (near-cCR) after nCRT at the Department of Colorectal Surgery of Fujian Medical University Union Hospital from May 2015 to February 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Case inclusion criteria: (1) Low rectal adenocarcinoma within 6 cm from the anal verge. (2) After nCRT, tumor presented markedly regression as mucosal nodule or abnormalities, superficial ulcer, scar or a mucosal erythema (< 2 cm); no regional lymph node metastasis or distant metastasis was found in rectal ultrasonography, pelvic MRI and PET-CT; MRI showed obvious fibrosis in the original tumor site; and post-treatment CEA was normal. (3) The patient and the family members adhered to receive the transanal full-thickness local excision with informed consent. (4) When the residual lesions were difficult to detect after nCRT, patients received the watch and wait (W&W) strategy. Exclusion criteria: (1) Before nCRT, pathological results showed poorly differentiated or signet-ring cell carcinoma; lateral lymph node metastasis was suspected. (2) When the residual lesion size was more than 3 cm after nCRT, it was difficult to perform local excision. The consolidation nCRT group received 3-4 cycles of CAPOX regimen (oxaliplatin and capecitabine) or six cycles of mFOLFOX6 (oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and 5-fluorouracil) combined with the long-course radiotherapy (intensity-modulated radiation therapy with a total dose of 50.4Gy). Patients with concurrent chemotherapy more than or equal to five cycles of CAPOX or eight cycles of mFOLFOX6 were defined as total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) group. Local resection was recommended for patients who were near-cCR according to modified MSKCC criteria 8-33 weeks after the end of radiotherapy. Patients with a near-cCR, who were judged as ycN0 according to PET-CT and MRI and were ypT0 after local excision, could enter the W&W strategy. Patients with pathologic stage more advanced than ypT1, and those with positive resection margin, or lymphovascular invasion were recommended for salvage radical surgery after local excision. The ypT1 patients with a negative resection margin and without lymphovascular invasion might receive the W&W management carefully if they refused radicalsurgery to sacrifice the sphincter for low rectal cancer. Results: Of 32 patients, 14 were males and 18 were females with the average age of 59 years old. Twenty-three patients underwent consolidation nCRT, and 9 received TNT. The first evaluation after treatments showed 19 cases with cCR and 13 with near-cCR. Twenty-nine patients received local excision while 3 patients with undetectable lesions received W&W policy. Four cases (12.5%) underwent salvage radical surgery with abdominoperineal resection. After local excision, 3 cases underwent salvage radical surgery immediately, and the final pathologic result was ypT3N0, ypT2N0, and ypT2N0 respectively, of whom 2 cases were in the group of consolidation CRT and 1 was in the TNT group. Of these 3 cases, 1 case with an initial cT3 stage showed a pathologic stage of ypT1 and a negative circumferential resection margin after consolidation nCRT and local excision, however, the final pathologic stage was ypT3 with fragmented tumor deposits in the mesorectum after the salvage radical surgery. Meanwhile 1 patient in the TNT group receiving W&W suffered from intraluminal regrowth after 7.4 months follow-up and underwent salvage abdominoperineal resection. One patient in the consolidation nCRT group died of stroke 42.5 months after local resection. Another patient in the TNT group had cerebral metastasis 10 months after the W&W policy, but no local recurrence was found in the pelvic cavity, then received resection of the metastatic tumors. The average follow-up for all the patients was 23 (5-51) months. The cumulative local regrowth rate was 5.0%. The overall survival rate was 85.7%, and the sphincter-preservation rate was increased from 25.0% (28/32) in the original plan to 87.5% (28/32) actually. The 3-year disease-free survival rate was 89.7%. The 3-year organ-preserving survival rate was 85.7%, and the 3-year stoma-free survival rate was 82.5%. At present, 31 patients still survived. Conclusions: After nCRT with consolidation chemotherapy or TNT for low rectal cancer, patients with cCR, ycN0 according to PET-CT and MRI, and ypT0 after local excision, can consider the W&W strategy. Strict patient selection with a near-cCR for local resection and sphincter-preserving strategy can reduce the local regrowth of cancer, and the short-term outcomes are satisfactory.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 21682102\nTitle: Role of FDG-PET/CT in follow-up of patients treated with resective gastric surgery for tumour.\nAuthors: Graziosi L, Bugiantella W, Cavazzoni E\nJournal: Annali italiani di chirurgia\nPublication Date: 2011 Mar-Apr\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION: Gastric cancer has a poor prognosis and a high rate of recurrences after surgery. The optimal method for assessing early recurrences is not defined: conventional imaging (ultrasonography, CT and MRI) have difficulty in detecting them, because they don't give information regarding metabolic features or tumor response to chemotherapy. Actually 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission (18FDG-PET) has several indications for the primary staging and the follow-up of colon-rectal, lung, breast, neck cancers and lymphoma, but its clinical role in gastric cancer is not assessed. Our study analyzes the role of 18FDG-PET integrated with CT scan in the detection of gastric cancer recurrence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 50 patients which underwent follow-up 18FDG-PET/CT from 2006 to 2009 after radical surgery for gastric adenocarcinoma. Each study was repeated every 6 months for the first two years after surgery and every 12 months for the subsequent three years. RESULTS: 18FDG-PET/CT was positive for suspected neoplastic disease in 29 (58%) and negative in 21 (42%) patients, with 3 false positive and 3 false negative results. 18FDG-PET/CT showed highly effectiveness in early detection of recurrences, as observed in 17 patients that were totally asymptomatic, allowing the initiation of multimodal treatment resulting in an important increasing of survival. CONCLUSIONS: 18FDG-PET-CT has a very good sensitivity (89.7%) and specificity (85.7%) in detecting local and distant recurrences during post-operative follow-up. Positive 18FDG-PET/CT findings may lead to an early change in the management of these patients, directing them towards rescue surgery or chemotherapy thereby improving their overall survival\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

(2020):** This study focuses on patients with *locally advanced* low rectal cancer who achieved a clinical response after neoadjuvant therapy (chemotherapy and radiation). They found a 3-year disease-free survival rate of 89.7% and an overall survival rate of 85.7%. However, this population is different from the patient in question, as it includes patients who received neoadjuvant radiation, and the focus is on sphincter preservation after achieving a significant response.\n*   **Graziosi et al.

In a randomized controlled trial of 849 patients, the value of preoperative radiotherapy in those with operable rectal adenocarcinoma was examined. After a minimum follow-up of 4 years, 156 patients who developed local recurrence were studied retrospectively. There were no differences concerning symptoms and the site of local recurrence between irradiated and non-irradiated patients.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in patients with rectal adenocarcinoma who underwent preoperative CCRT and surgery at the Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital from January 2018 to December 2022. Data were collected from patients to investigate the associations between pathological prognostic factors and local recurrence of rectal adenocarcinoma. For the analysis of continuous variables, the Student's t-test was employed to assess univariate associations. In the case of categorical variables, comparisons were made using the chi-square test and the Kruskal-Wallis test. Furthermore, the Kaplan-Meier method, supplemented by the log-rank test, was utilized to examine the relationships between baseline prognostic variables and disease-free survival endpoints. RESULTS: Of the 70 patients who received preoperative CCRT, 14 (20%) experienced recurrence. Univariate log-rank analysis identified five pathologic predictors of the disease-free survival of preoperative CCRT patients: ypT stage (p = 0.0030), lymphatic space invasion (p = 0.0033), venous invasion (p = 0.0345), circumferential resection margin (CRM) (p = 0.0003), and TNM staging (p = 0.0109). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, ypTNM stage and CRM status were independent predictors for disease progression of preoperative CCRT patients. CONCLUSION: ypTNM staging and CRM status emerged as independent predictors of local recurrence. The study also identified age and gender variations in rectal cancer incidence, highlighting the importance of tailored screening approaches.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 33011726\nTitle: Current Surgical Strategies for the Treatment of Rectal Adenocarcinoma and the Risk of Local Recurrence.\nAuthors: Longchamp G, Meyer J, Abbassi Z\nJournal: Digestive diseases (Basel, Switzerland)\nPublication Date: 2021\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Despite new medical and surgical strategies, 5-year local recurrence of rectal adenocarcinoma was reported in up to 25% of cases. Therefore, we aimed to review surgical strategies for the prevention of local recurrences in rectal cancer. SUMMARY: After implementation of the total mesorectal excision (TME), surgical resection of rectal adenocarcinoma with anterior resection or abdominoperineal excision (APE) allowed decrease in local recurrence (3% at 5 years). More recently, extralevator APE was described as an alternative to APE, decreasing specimen perforation and recurrence rate. Moreover, technique modifications were developed to optimize rectal resection, such as the laparoscopic or robotic approach, and transanal TME. However, the technical advantages conferred by these techniques did not translate into a decreased recurrence rate. Lateral lymph node dissection is another technique, which aimed at improving the long-term outcomes; nevertheless, there is currently no evidence to recommend its routine use. Strategies to preserve the rectum are also emerging, such as local excision, and may be beneficial for subgroups of patients. Key Messages: Rectal cancer management requires a multidisciplinary approach, and surgical strategy should be tailored to patient factors: general health, previous perineal intervention, anatomy, preference, and tumor characteristics such as stage and localization.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of resecting the local recurrence of rectal cancer and to analyze factors that might predict curative resection and those that affect survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was performed in 50 patients who underwent surgical exploration with intent to cure LRRC between April 1998 and April 2005. All of the patients had previously undergone resection of primary rectal adenocarcinoma. Of these patients' charts, operation and pathology reports were reviewed. Primary tumor and treatment details, hospital of initial treatment and TNM stage were registered. The following data were collected concerning the detection of the local recurrence; date of recurrence, symptoms at the time of presentation and diagnostic work-up. Perioperative complication and date of discharge were also gathered. The recurrent tumors were classified as not fixed (F0), fixed at one site (F1) and fixed to two or more sites (F2) according to the preoperative and peroperative findings. Microscopic involvement of surgical margins and localization of recurrence were noted based on pathology reports. RESULTS: The median time interval between resection of primary tumor and surgery for locally recurrent disease was 24 (4-113) months. In a statistical analysis, initial surgery, complaints of patients, increasing number of sites of the recurrent tumor fixation in the pelvis, location of the recurrent tumor were associated with curative surgery. Curative, negative resection margins were obtained in 24 (48%) of patients; in these patients a median survival of 28 months was achieved, compared to 12 months (p=0.01) in patients with either microscopic or gross residual disease. Primary operation and CEA level at recurrence were also found to be important factors associated with improved survival. There was no operative mortality and, the complication rate was 24%. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that many patients with LRRC can be resected with negative margins. The type of primary surgery, symptoms, location, and fixity of recurrent tumor are associated with the increased possibility of carrying out curative resection. Previous surgery and curative surgery are significant predictors of both disease-specific survival and overall survival.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 8173929\nTitle: Local recurrence of rectal adenocarcinoma after 'curative' surgery with and without preoperative radiotherapy.\nAuthors: Holm T, Cedermark B, Rutqvist LE\nJournal: The British journal of surgery\nPublication Date: 1994 Mar\nAbstract: The natural history of locally recurrent rectal cancer was analysed to assess whether preoperative irradiation altered the clinical course of the disease. In a randomized controlled trial of 849 patients, the value of preoperative radiotherapy in those with operable rectal adenocarcinoma was examined. After a minimum follow-up of 4 years, 156 patients who developed local recurrence were studied retrospectively. There were no differences concerning symptoms and the site of local recurrence between irradiated and non-irradiated patients. Curative treatment was rarely possible and median survival was only about 1 year, irrespective of adjuvant treatment. Local recurrence was the only manifestation of disease in 30-50 per cent of patients. An earlier and more aggressive surgical approach might improve survival.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 29394637\nTitle: [A Case of Recurrent Rectal Cancer with Adrenal and Lung Metastasis with More than Ten-Year Survival after Surgery].\nAuthors: Uchiyama K, Katarao Y, Kimura Y\nJournal: Gan to kagaku ryoho. Cancer & chemotherapy\nPublication Date: 2017 Nov\nAbstract: A 60-year-old man underwent low anterior resection for rectal cancer. Histological findings indicated well-differentiated adenocarcinoma(T3[SS]N1M0, ly3, v2, Stage III a). Two years and 1 month later, right adrenalectomy was performed for solitary adrenal metastasis. Three months thereafter, left partial pulmonary resection was performed for a metastatic lung tumor. All resected specimens showed metastatic adenocarcinoma derived from the rectal cancer. The patient is alive and well without recurrence for more than 10years after lung resection. Given that adrenal metastasis is usually found as widespread metastasis, aggressive resection of well-controlled metastatic lesions including those in the adrenal glands is recommended.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Previous studies have shown promising results in patients with Microsatellite Stable microsatellite-stable CRC refractory to chemotherapy upon treating with (Programmed Cell Death Protein 1) PD-1 inhibitor combined with regorafenib. Herein, we report a unique case of a patient for whom the conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy were ineffective, but showed a prolonged stable disease with third-line treatment with regorafenib and PD-1 inhibitor, sintilimab. CASE PRESENTATION: A 64-year-old East Asian female patient was admitted to a regional cancer hospital presenting with abdominal unease due to increased stool frequency and bloody stool. Digital anal examination revealed adenocarcinoma, while genetic profiling of the tumor resections detected wild-type KRAS mutations in codon 12 and 13. Microsatellite instability (MSI) analysis for detecting germline mutations of (Mismatch-repair) MMR genes showed stable phenotype. In December 2016, Miles' resection for intestinal adhesion release and iliac vessel exploration in the rectum was performed (Tumor, Node, Metastasis [TNM]: T3N0M0; stage IIA). The adjuvant chemotherapeutic regimen consisted of a combination of capecitabine at 1.5 g (twice daily) and oxaliplatin therapy at 200 mg for three cycles from February 2016; followed by administering capecitabine tablets orally (1.5 g bid) for five cycles as post-operative palliative care. The patient tested positive for hepatic C virus, which was managed by oral antiviral agents. Following recurrence of rectal adenocarcinoma after 4 years and disease progression with a previous chemotherapeutic regimen, regorafenib was administered at 120 mg once daily combined with sintilimab 200 mg, and the patient's progress was monitored. A follow-up computerized tomography imaging in March 2020 showed disease progression, additionally presented nodule formation (TNM: T3NxM1b; stage IVB). According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria (RECIST), the patient showed a complete response (CR) after treatment with regorafenib and sintilimab immunotherapy. CONCLUSION: Data from this clinical case report support future exploration of combination treatment of the oral multi-kinase inhibitor regorafenib with PD-1 targeted monoclonal antibodies in patients with metastatic microsatellite-stable CRC.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 26031861\nTitle: Long-term oncologic results in cancer of the rectum treated by preoperative chemoradiotherapy and surgery: An analysis of 500 cases.\nAuthors: Cienfuegos JA, Baixauli J, Pastor C\nJournal: Revista espanola de enfermedades digestivas\nPublication Date: 2015 Jun\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: The standard treatment for locally advanced cancer of the rectum (LACR) and selective cases of stage IV disease is preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by total mesorectal excision (TME). Despite reductions in local recurrence, disease-free survival (DSF) has remained stable in recent years. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to analyze patterns of recurrence, long-term survival and prognostic factors in a program of neoadjuvant CRT and surgery in LACR. METHODS: Between January 1992 and December 2011, 446 patients with LACR and 54 patients (with single metastases) were treated with pre-operative long course CRT and surgery. Three hundred forty four (66.8%) anterior resections of the rectum and 123 (24.6%) abdomino-perineal resections were performed. RESULTS: With a mean follow-up of 70.06 months, local recurrence was 4.8% and distant recurrence 25.5%. No differences were found in the histopathologic prognostic factors across the three groups studied depending on distance (cm) from the analmargin. Involvement of the circumferential resection margin (CRM+) was significantly greater in tumors in the distal third of the rectum (8.5%; p = 0.04). 67 patients (13.4%) showed a complete pathologic response. DSF at 5 and 10 years was significantly lower in patients with tumors affecting the distal third as compared to the middle third of the rectum (61.9% vs. 57.7%; p = 0.04). Tumors at this distal location resulted in a significantly higher incidence of lung metastases (p = 0.016).\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 26231173\nTitle: Durable recurrence-free survival after pneumonectomy for late lung metastasis from rectal cancer: case report with genetic and epigenetic analyses.\nAuthors: Imperatori A, Rotolo N, Dominioni L\nJournal: BMC cancer\nPublication Date: 2015 Aug 1\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Treatment of pulmonary recurrence from colorectal cancer involving the main bronchus usually entails palliation using interventional bronchoscopy, because the prognosis is generally very poor. Surgical experience has clarified that in this setting pneumonectomy should only be performed in carefully selected patients showing favorable prognostic profiles (defined by low carcinoembryonic antigen serum levels pre-thoracotomy), solitary and completely resectable pulmonary metastasis, and long disease-free intervals. In the few long-term survivors after pneumonectomy for late-recurrent colorectal cancer, the disease has a relatively indolent metastatic course and genetic and epigenetic profiling may provide further insight regarding tumor evolution. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a rare case of late hilar-endobronchial and lymph nodal recurrence of rectal cancer, sequential to hepatic metastasectomy, that we successfully treated with pneumonectomy and chemotherapy (leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin regimen); the patient achieved 7-year relapse-free survival after lung metastasectomy and 24-year overall survival after primary rectal cancer resection. To our knowledge, this is the longest survival reported after sequential liver resection and pneumonectomy for recurrent colorectal cancer. In our case the primary rectal cancer and its recurrences showed identical immunohistochemical patterns. The primary rectal cancer and the matched metastases (hepatic, pulmonary and lymph nodal) demonstrated no KRAS, NRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations, a microsatellite stable phenotype, and no tumor protein p53 alterations or recurrent copy number alterations on chromosome 8. High genetic concordances between the paired primary tumor and metastases suggest that the key tumor biological traits remained relatively conserved in the three metastatic sites. Minor differences in gene specific hypermethylation were observed between the primary tumor and lung and nodal metastases. These differences suggest that epigenetic mechanisms may be causally involved in the microenvironmental regulation of cancer metastasis. CONCLUSION: The exceptionally long survival of the patient in our case study involving favorable clinical features was related to an excellent response to surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy; however, genetic or epigenetic factors that remain unidentified cannot be excluded as contributory factors. Our findings support the concept of a common clonal origin of the primary cancer and synchronous and late metastases, and suggest that aberrant DNA methylation may regulate tumor dormancy mechanisms.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

We report the case of a colonic cancer in a 78 years old female patient, who underwent her first operation in 1987 for a symptomatic T4 carcinoma. Since then, the patient has always denied any form of follow-up examination and adjuvant therapy. Recently, she has undergone her fourth operation, which for the first time demonstrated peritoneal carcinosis, and is still in very good health.Clinical experience shows that in some cases standard therapies may unexpectedly produce extremely long survival times. This has to be kept in mind when the value of prognostic markers is discussed and limits the validity of survival data in the context of small scale studies dealing with especially extended therapeutic protocols.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 26231173\nTitle: Durable recurrence-free survival after pneumonectomy for late lung metastasis from rectal cancer: case report with genetic and epigenetic analyses.\nAuthors: Imperatori A, Rotolo N, Dominioni L\nJournal: BMC cancer\nPublication Date: 2015 Aug 1\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Treatment of pulmonary recurrence from colorectal cancer involving the main bronchus usually entails palliation using interventional bronchoscopy, because the prognosis is generally very poor. Surgical experience has clarified that in this setting pneumonectomy should only be performed in carefully selected patients showing favorable prognostic profiles (defined by low carcinoembryonic antigen serum levels pre-thoracotomy), solitary and completely resectable pulmonary metastasis, and long disease-free intervals. In the few long-term survivors after pneumonectomy for late-recurrent colorectal cancer, the disease has a relatively indolent metastatic course and genetic and epigenetic profiling may provide further insight regarding tumor evolution. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a rare case of late hilar-endobronchial and lymph nodal recurrence of rectal cancer, sequential to hepatic metastasectomy, that we successfully treated with pneumonectomy and chemotherapy (leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin regimen); the patient achieved 7-year relapse-free survival after lung metastasectomy and 24-year overall survival after primary rectal cancer resection. To our knowledge, this is the longest survival reported after sequential liver resection and pneumonectomy for recurrent colorectal cancer. In our case the primary rectal cancer and its recurrences showed identical immunohistochemical patterns. The primary rectal cancer and the matched metastases (hepatic, pulmonary and lymph nodal) demonstrated no KRAS, NRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations, a microsatellite stable phenotype, and no tumor protein p53 alterations or recurrent copy number alterations on chromosome 8. High genetic concordances between the paired primary tumor and metastases suggest that the key tumor biological traits remained relatively conserved in the three metastatic sites. Minor differences in gene specific hypermethylation were observed between the primary tumor and lung and nodal metastases. These differences suggest that epigenetic mechanisms may be causally involved in the microenvironmental regulation of cancer metastasis. CONCLUSION: The exceptionally long survival of the patient in our case study involving favorable clinical features was related to an excellent response to surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy; however, genetic or epigenetic factors that remain unidentified cannot be excluded as contributory factors. Our findings support the concept of a common clonal origin of the primary cancer and synchronous and late metastases, and suggest that aberrant DNA methylation may regulate tumor dormancy mechanisms.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 28550452\nTitle: Evaluation of Long-Term Outcomes of Microsatellite Instability Status in an Asian Cohort of Sporadic Colorectal Cancers.\nAuthors: Tan WJ, Hamzah JL, Acharyya S\nJournal: Journal of gastrointestinal cancer\nPublication Date: 2018 Sep\nAbstract: PURPOSE: Microsatellite instability in colorectal cancer (CRC) and its long-term outcomes remains poorly studied in Asians. We investigate the prognostic significance of microsatellite instability in an Asian population and assess its clinical impact in patients who undergo adjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS: Six hundred fifty-four consecutive CRC patients who underwent surgical resection between January 2010 and December 2012 were recruited. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier approach. Univariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the hazard ratios for variables associated with survival. A subgroup analyses was performed for stage III patients who underwent chemotherapy to evaluate the prognostic significance of microsatellite instability in this group. RESULTS: Five hundred ninety-one (90.4%) patients were microsatellite stable (MSS) while 63 (9.6%) were microsatellite instable (MSI). Three years recurrence-free survival (RFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were 83.7 versus 73.7% (p = 0.295) and 87.1 versus 91.2% (p = 0.307) in MSS and MSI tumors, respectively. Among stage III patients who received adjuvant therapy, MSI status was found to be an adverse prognostic factor for RFS (HR 2.74 (95% CI 1.43-5.26), p = 0.002). This remained significant on multivariate analysis (HR 2.38 (95% CI 1.15-4.93), p = 0.018). Adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with survival benefit for patients with MSS tumors (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17-0.69, p = 0.002) but not MSI tumors (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.08-8.15, p = 0.750). CONCLUSIONS: MSI status is not a prognostic indicator in the general CRC population but appears to be an adverse prognostic indicator for RFS in stage III CRC patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

chemotherapeutic agent. It was originally investigated for its antiviral effects, but it is now used as an anticancer therapy for various cancers.[A233135] Gemcitabine is a cytidine analog with two fluorine atoms replacing the hydroxyl on the ribose.[A233145] As a prodrug, gemcitabine is transformed into its active metabolites that work by replacing the building blocks of nucleic acids during DNA elongation, arresting tumour growth and promoting apoptosis of malignant cells.[L32960] The structure, metabolism, and mechanism of action of gemcitabine are similar to [cytarabine], but gemcitabine has a wider spectrum of antitumour activity.[A233140]\r\n\r\nGemcitabine is marketed as Gemzar and it is available as intravenous injection. It is approved by the FDA to treat advanced ovarian cancer in combination with [carboplatin], metastatic breast cancer in combination with [paclitaxel], non-small cell lung cancer in combination with [cisplatin], and pancreatic cancer as monotherapy.[L32950] It is also being investigated in other cancer and tumour types.\nCisplatin: Cisplatin, cisplatinum or cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (CDDP) is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug used to treat various types of cancers, including sarcomas, some carcinomas (e.g. small cell lung cancer, and ovarian cancer), lymphomas and germ cell tumors. It was the first member of its class, which now also includes carboplatin and oxaliplatin.\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: timeline4.txt] included in your context\nAGE: 56.026, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 4.6000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 56.270, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 5.3000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 56.273, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: Indeterminate, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: Indeterminate, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 56.273, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 56.273, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), CT, TUMOR_SITE: Lung, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 56.273, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), CT, TUMOR_SITE: Other, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 56.823, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: Yes, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 56.823, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 56.826, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 4.8000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 57.111, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: Yes, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: No, OTHER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 57.111, diagnosis > performance_status --> ECOG: 1, \nAGE: 57.111, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has progressed.\nAGE: 57.111, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), CT, TUMOR_SITE: Other, PELVIS: No, OTHER: Yes, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 57.138, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, HAS_CANCER: Yes, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, PELVIS: No, OTHER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 57.138, diagnosis > progression --> PROGRESSION: Y, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, \nAGE: 57.138, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), MR, TUMOR_SITE: Other, PELVIS: No, OTHER: Yes, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 57.152, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 57.152, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 57.152, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), CT, TUMOR_SITE: Lung, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 57.152, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), CT, TUMOR_SITE: Pleura, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 57.360, specimen --> SAMPLE_ID: P-0041381-T01-IM6, \nAGE: 57.371, diagnosis > performance_status --> ECOG: 0, \nAGE: 57.371, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 5.8000 ng/ml          \n\n[DrugBank: Veal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0041381-T01-IM6\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0041381\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Colorectal Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Rectum\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Rectal Adenocarcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT468\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 368, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 30.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"READ\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

Nevertheless, up to 10% of patients develop a local relapse. Surgical R0 resection is the only chance of a cure in the treatment of locally recurrent rectal cancer (LRRC). Due to the altered anatomy and physiology of the true pelvis as a result of the pretreatment and operations as well as the localization and extent of the recurrence, the treatment decision is individualized and remains a challenge for the interdisciplinary team. Even locally advanced tumors with involvement of adjacent structures can be treated in designated centers using multimodal treatment concepts with potentially curative intent.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 25923493\nTitle: [The treatment of locally recurrent rectal cancer].\nAuthors: Alberda WJ, Verhoef C, Nuyttens JJ\nJournal: Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde\nPublication Date: 2015\nAbstract: Its incidence has decreased in recent decades due to advances in the treatment of patients with primary rectal cancer, but LRRC still occurs in 6-10% of these patients. LRRC is often accompanied by severe, progressive pain and has a major impact on quality of life. Curative treatment is possible based on surgical resection combined with chemoradiotherapy. Radical resection is the most important prognostic factor in curative treatment. Neo-adjuvant systemic therapy may further improve outcomes in LRRC patients. Many patients are not eligible for surgical treatment due to the presence of metastases or irresectability of the local recurrence. These patients should receive optimal palliative care for the disabling pain. Radiotherapy is effective against local pain in around 75% of patients but the duration of palliation is limited.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 25989927\nTitle: Surgical options for locally recurrent rectal cancer--review and update.\nAuthors: Troja A, El-Sourani N, Abdou A\nJournal: International journal of colorectal disease\nPublication Date: 2015 Sep\nAbstract: Locally recurrent rectal tumours in the pelvis are found in about 6% following treatment for rectal cancer. This type of tumour can cause serious local complications and symptoms. The aim of modern surgical oncology is to offer a curative treatment option embedded in an interdisciplinary network of specialities to the patient. Due to advancements in surgical techniques and procedures, especially regarding surgical reconstruction, the possibilities of a curative treatment regarding recurrent cancers have been expanded and established. To aim for a curative treatment one must introduce a multimodal therapy including radio- and chemotherapy, and a radical oncological surgery with en bloc resection of the tumour and affected surrounding organs to achieve a R0-resection.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 76 patients with iLR who had undergone radical surgery for a primary tumor from 2003 to 2015. RESULTS: The iLR rate was 2.5%. From 76 patients, 39 patients underwent R0 resection for iLR. Multivariate analysis revealed that initial open surgery, neoadjuvant chemoradiation, and p/ypT >/= 3 were poor prognostic factors after iLR as regard to the variables related to the primary tumor; and symptom presence at the time of iLR diagnosis, higher fixity, and no chemotherapy after iLR were associated with shorter overall survival after iLR, and R0 resection of LRRC was the only favorable prognostic factor for progression-free survival after iLR as regard to the variables related to LRRC. Higher tumor level, negative pathologic circumferential margin of the primary tumor, and low fixity of LRRC were favorable factors in achieving R0 resection of LRRC. CONCLUSIONS: Early detection of iLR before symptom development, use of chemotherapy after iLR and R0 resection of LRRC should be considered to improve survival outcomes after iLR.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 22213210\nTitle: Reirradiation to the pelvis for recurrent rectal cancer.\nAuthors: Koom WS, Choi Y, Shim SJ\nJournal: Journal of surgical oncology\nPublication Date: 2012 Jun 1\nAbstract: OBJECTIVES: This study investigated late toxicity and infield progression-free survival in patients with locally recurrent rectal cancer (LRRC) who had previously received irradiation to the pelvis. METHODS: Twenty-two patients were treated by reirradiation to the pelvis between January 2000 and August 2007. All patients received curative surgery with preoperative or postoperative chemoradiotherapy as an initial treatment. Five patients (23%) underwent surgical resection after reirradiation. The median follow-up duration was 20 months (range, 7-91 months). RESULTS: Two patients (9%) had grade-3 acute toxicity and eight patients (36%) had grade-3 to -4 late toxicity. The incidence of grade-3 to -4 late toxicity in the gastrointestinal and urinary system was 18% and 27%, respectively. Recurrent tumor location (axial or anterior) and surgical resection after reirradiation significantly influenced severe late toxicity (P = 0.024 and P = 0.039, respectively). In the 17 patients not undergoing surgery after reirradiation, median infield progression-free survival was 16 months. Reirradiation doses exceeding 50 Gy(alphabeta10) (equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions) significantly increased the infield progression-free survival (P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Tumor location (axial or anterior) and surgery after reirradiation may increase severe late toxicity. In addition, an EQD2 exceeding 50 Gy(alphabeta10) may improve infield control.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 21209587\nTitle: Surgery for locally recurrent rectal cancer in the era of total mesorectal excision: is there still a chance for cure?\nAuthors: Rahbari NN, Ulrich AB, Bruckner T\nJournal: Annals of surgery\nPublication Date: 2011 Mar\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the perioperative outcome and long-term survival of patients who underwent surgical resection for recurrent rectal cancer within a multimodal approach in the era of total mesorectal excision (TME). BACKGROUND: Introduction of TME has reduced local recurrence and improved oncological outcome of patients with rectal cancer. Local recurrence after TME still occurs in 2% to 8% of patients and presents a challenge to surgical and medical oncologists. However, there has been very limited data on the perioperative and long-term outcome of patients who are operated for local recurrence in the era of TME. METHODS: A total of 107 patients who were identified from a prospective rectal cancer database underwent surgical exploration for recurrent rectal cancer after previous TME between October 2001 and April 2009. Risk factors of perioperative morbidity were analyzed using a multivariate logistic regression model. Independent predictors of disease-specific survival were identified by a Cox proportional hazards regression model, as were those of local recurrence and disease recurrence at any site. RESULTS: Surgical resection was performed in 92 patients and negative resection margins were achieved in 54 (58.7%) of these. Recurrent disease was located intraluminally and extraluminally in 35 (38.0%) patients and 57 (62.0%) patients, respectively. A total of 19 (20.6%) patients had metastatic extrapelvic disease at the time of surgery. Perioperative surgical morbidity and in-hospital mortality accounted for 42.4% and 3.3%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, partial sacrectomy was associated with surgical morbidity (P = 0.004). Three- and 5-year disease-specific survival rates were 61% and 47%. Three-year survival rate of patients with extrapelvic disease who underwent R0 resection was 42%. On multivariate analysis, surgical morbidity (P = 0.001), presence of extrapelvic disease (P = 0.006), and noncurative (R1; R2) resection (P < 0.0001) were identified as independent adverse predictors of disease-specific survival, whereas a transabdominal resection (as opposed to an abdominoperineal resection/pelvic exenteration) was associated with a more favorable prognosis (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Surgical resection of local recurrence from rectal cancer in the era TME can be carried out with acceptable morbidity and curative resection rates. Curative resection remains the major prognostic factor and may enable long-term survival even in patients with extrapelvic disease.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

It was originally investigated for its antiviral effects, but it is now used as an anticancer therapy for various cancers.[A233135] Gemcitabine is a cytidine analog with two fluorine atoms replacing the hydroxyl on the ribose.[A233145] As a prodrug, gemcitabine is transformed into its active metabolites that work by replacing the building blocks of nucleic acids during DNA elongation, arresting tumour growth and promoting apoptosis of malignant cells.[L32960] The structure, metabolism, and mechanism of action of gemcitabine are similar to [cytarabine], but gemcitabine has a wider spectrum of antitumour activity.[A233140]\r\n\r\nGemcitabine is marketed as Gemzar and it is available as intravenous injection. It is approved by the FDA to treat advanced ovarian cancer in combination with [carboplatin], metastatic breast cancer in combination with [paclitaxel], non-small cell lung cancer in combination with [cisplatin], and pancreatic cancer as monotherapy.[L32950] It is also being investigated in other cancer and tumour types.\nCisplatin: Cisplatin, cisplatinum or cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (CDDP) is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug used to treat various types of cancers, including sarcomas, some carcinomas (e.g. small cell lung cancer, and ovarian cancer), lymphomas and germ cell tumors.

Colonoscopy revealed a 50 x 50 mm rectal tumor with bleeding. Based on close inspection, he was diagnosed with unresectable advanced rectal cancer with multiple liver metastases. Chemotherapy was administered as 10 cycles of bevacizumab + mFOLFOX6 and 7 cycles of bevacizumab + FOLFIRI. Nine months later, he presented with hematochezia and progression of anemia. It was difficult to stop the bleeding via endoscopy. He underwent radiation therapy (39 Gy in 13 fractions), and hemostasis was confirmed. Then, further chemotherapy was performed with 3 cycles of bevacizumab + FOLFIRI and 2 cycles of TAS102. However 14 months after the initial visit, he presented with right hypochondralgia and abdominal fullness due to the progression of multiple liver metastases. Palliative low-dose whole-liver radiation therapy (WLRT) (30 Gy in 10 fractions) was performed. He developed Grade 2 nausea, but his right hypochondralgia reduced, liver dysfunction improved, and he successfully completed radiotherapy. At approximately the same time his anemia progressed, and colonoscopy revealed recurrent bleeding from the tumor. Re-irradiation (15 Gy in 5 fractions) of the rectal tumor was carried out and a blood transfusion was performed for the bleeding. He was discharged after confirmation the anemia had not progressed. Few reports have been published on the use of both palliative re-irradiation to stop bleeding from rectal cancer and palliative low-dose WLRT. Based on our experience with this case, we believe that palliative radiotherapy can be useful in treating patients with a poor prognosis.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 15043733\nTitle: Is palliative resection of the primary tumour, in the presence of advanced rectal cancer, a safe and useful technique for symptom control?\nAuthors: Al-Sanea N, Isbister WH\nJournal: ANZ journal of surgery\nPublication Date: 2004 Apr\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION: At some time, every general surgeon will be faced with the task of trying to decide what to do with a patient who presents with rectal cancer and unresectable distant metastases. How safe is resectional surgery? What sort of palliation may be expected following resection of the primary tumour? In an attempt to answer these questions, the management and outcomes of all patients with rectal cancer and distant metastases, who were primarily referred to the colorectal unit at King Faisal Specialist Hospital were examined. METHODS: All patients who underwent primary surgery for rectal cancer in the presence of metastatic disease were identified. The charts of these patients were examined and their morbidity, mortality and survival were determined. RESULTS: Over an 8-year period 22 patients (average age 54 years) underwent rectal resectional surgery in the presence of metastatic disease. There were 13 men and nine women. The commonest complaint was rectal bleeding. All patients had chest radiographs. Pulmonary metastases were identified in four patients. Nineteen abdominal and pelvic computed tomography scans were performed and eight showed evidence of metastases. Skeletal radiographs in two patients showed evidence of bone metastasis. At operation, intraperitoneal metastases were found in 18 patients. Nine of these were not identified preoperatively. Six patients underwent abdomino-perineal resection, nine anterior resection and seven a Hartmann's procedure. Eight patients developed a significant postoperative complication and one died 42 days after surgery. The mean length of hospital stay was 18.6 days. Nine patients received preoperative radiotherapy. Four patients had palliative radiotherapy, two for bony, one for liver and one for peritoneal metastases. Patients were followed up for a mean of 1.1 years. During follow up, 11 returned to the emergency room on 24 occasions. Two patients required readmission. No patient had further rectal bleeding. The mean survival was 1.3 years. CONCLUSION: Patients with rectal cancer and unresectable distant metastases can be successfully palliated by resection of the primary tumour with low morbidity and mortality. The early involvement of a palliative care team facilitates patient management and helps patients enjoy what remains of the rest of their lives at home, in comfort and with good symptom control.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 12925091\nTitle: Isolated chemotherapeutic perfusion of the pelvis for advanced rectal cancer.\nAuthors: Wanebo HJ, Belliveau J, Begossi G\nJournal: Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland\nPublication Date: 2003 Sep\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE: Isolated pelvic perfusion exposes tissue to high doses of drug without the toxicity of high-dose systemic therapy and may benefit patients with advanced malignancy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: There were 32 patients with locally advanced, previously irradiated cancer of the rectum and 5 patients with anal canal cancer. These patients underwent a total of 65 isolated pelvic perfusions using 5-Fu (1500 mg/m2) for 60 min; cisplatinum (100 mg/m2) and mitomycin (10-20 mg/m2) were added to some perfusions. Hospital stay averaged 3-5 days. RESULTS: Palliative perfusion in 15 patients with advanced rectal cancer resulted in symptomatic relief from 1 to 4 months in 11 of 14 with pelvic pain and limited benefit in 6 patients with mass, but no pain. Pre-operative perfusion in 16 rectal cancer patients achieved a complete response (no tumour in pelvis) in 1 patient and significant tumour regression in 8 patients rendering them potentially resectable. Five were resected with clear margins. Three patients with recurrent epidermoid cancer had significant tumour regression and were resected with clear margins. CONCLUSION: Isolated chemotherapeutic perfusion of the pelvis provides excellent palliation for patients with advanced or pelvic recurrence of rectal cancer or epidermoid cancer of anorectum and may potentiate resection in selected patients.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

        "content": "Okay, I have reviewed the PubMed search results regarding palliative care in advanced rectal cancer. Here's a summary:\n\n*   **Yasuda et al. (2020):** Describes a case report of successful palliative radiotherapy (re-irradiation and whole-liver radiation) for symptom control in a patient with unresectable advanced rectal cancer and liver metastases.\n*   **Al-Sanea & Isbister (2004):** Suggests that palliative resection of the primary tumor can be a safe and useful technique for symptom control in patients with metastatic rectal cancer, with low morbidity and mortality. Early involvement of a palliative care team is emphasized.\n*   **Wanebo et al. (2003):** Discusses isolated pelvic perfusion as a palliative option, providing symptomatic relief and potentially enabling resection in selected patients.\n\nConsidering these findings, and the patient's current clinical status \u2013 widespread metastatic disease (including brain metastases), declining performance status, and limited treatment options \u2013 the focus should shift towards maximizing quality of life through palliative care. While interventions like radiation therapy may provide temporary symptom relief, they are unlikely to significantly alter the long-term prognosis.\n\nGiven the aggressive disease course and the limited effectiveness of further curative treatments, I maintain my assessment.\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"

It was originally investigated for its antiviral effects, but it is now used as an anticancer therapy for various cancers.[A233135] Gemcitabine is a cytidine analog with two fluorine atoms replacing the hydroxyl on the ribose.[A233145] As a prodrug, gemcitabine is transformed into its active metabolites that work by replacing the building blocks of nucleic acids during DNA elongation, arresting tumour growth and promoting apoptosis of malignant cells.[L32960] The structure, metabolism, and mechanism of action of gemcitabine are similar to [cytarabine], but gemcitabine has a wider spectrum of antitumour activity.[A233140]\r\n\r\nGemcitabine is marketed as Gemzar and it is available as intravenous injection. It is approved by the FDA to treat advanced ovarian cancer in combination with [carboplatin], metastatic breast cancer in combination with [paclitaxel], non-small cell lung cancer in combination with [cisplatin], and pancreatic cancer as monotherapy.[L32950] It is also being investigated in other cancer and tumour types.\nCisplatin: Cisplatin, cisplatinum or cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (CDDP) is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug used to treat various types of cancers, including sarcomas, some carcinomas (e.g. small cell lung cancer, and ovarian cancer), lymphomas and germ cell tumors. It was the first member of its class, which now also includes carboplatin and oxaliplatin.\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: timeline4.txt] included in your context\nAGE: 56.026, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 4.6000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 56.270, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 5.3000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 56.273, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: Indeterminate, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: Indeterminate, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 56.273, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 56.273, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), CT, TUMOR_SITE: Lung, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 56.273, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), CT, TUMOR_SITE: Other, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 56.823, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: Yes, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 56.823, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 56.826, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 4.8000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 57.111, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: Yes, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: No, OTHER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 57.111, diagnosis > performance_status --> ECOG: 1, \nAGE: 57.111, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has progressed.\nAGE: 57.111, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), CT, TUMOR_SITE: Other, PELVIS: No, OTHER: Yes, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 57.138, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, HAS_CANCER: Yes, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, PELVIS: No, OTHER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 57.138, diagnosis > progression --> PROGRESSION: Y, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, \nAGE: 57.138, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), MR, TUMOR_SITE: Other, PELVIS: No, OTHER: Yes, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 57.152, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 57.152, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 57.152, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), CT, TUMOR_SITE: Lung, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 57.152, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), CT, TUMOR_SITE: Pleura, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 57.360, specimen --> SAMPLE_ID: P-0041381-T01-IM6, \nAGE: 57.371, diagnosis > performance_status --> ECOG: 0, \nAGE: 57.371, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 5.8000 ng/ml          \n\n[DrugBank: Veal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0041381-T01-IM6\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0041381\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Colorectal Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Rectum\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Rectal Adenocarcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT468\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 368, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 30.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"READ\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).
