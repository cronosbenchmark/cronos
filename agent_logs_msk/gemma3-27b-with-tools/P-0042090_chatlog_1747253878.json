This phase II study explored this association prospectively at the protein and mRNA-expression level. METHODS: Treatment-naive patients with nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer (stage IIIB/IV) had four cycles of first-line chemotherapy with pemetrexed/cisplatin. Nonprogressing patients continued on pemetrexed maintenance until progression or maximum tolerability. TS expression (nucleus/cytoplasm/total) was assessed in diagnostic tissue samples by immunohistochemistry (IHC; H-scores), and quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Cox regression was used to assess the association between H-scores and progression-free/overall survival (PFS/OS) distribution estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Maximal chi(2) analysis identified optimal cutpoints between low TS- and high TS-expression groups, yielding maximal associations with PFS/OS. RESULTS: The study enrolled 70 patients; of these 43 (61.4%) started maintenance treatment. In 60 patients with valid H-scores, median (m) PFS was 5.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.9-6.9) months, mOS was 9.6 (95% CI, 7.3-15.7) months. Higher nuclear TS expression was significantly associated with shorter PFS and OS (primary analysis IHC, PFS: p < 0.0001; hazard ratio per 1-unit increase: 1.015; 95%CI, 1.008-1.021). At the optimal cutpoint of nuclear H-score (70), mPFS in the low TS- versus high TS-expression groups was 7.1 (5.7-8.3) versus 2.6 (1.3-4.1) months (p = 0.0015; hazard ratio = 0.28; 95%CI, 0.16-0.52; n = 40/20). Trends were similar for cytoplasm H-scores, quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and other clinical endpoints (OS, response, and disease control). CONCLUSIONS: The primary endpoint was met; low TS expression was associated with longer PFS. Further randomized studies are needed to explore nuclear TS IHC expression as a potential biomarker of clinical outcomes for pemetrexed treatment in larger patient cohorts.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

In clinical practice, however, all the patients cannot receive LAT for oligo-PD. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of additional bevacizumab as an alternative to LAT for oligo-PD after the EGFR-TKI failure in previously treated lung adenocarcinoma patients (median number of previous therapies, 2 regimens). Oligo-PD was defined as a situation in which disease progression has occurred in less than 5 anatomical sites after EGFR-TKI that has achieved at least stable disease. RESULTS: During a median 29.6-month follow-up period from the initiation of EGFR-TKI, 9 patients developed oligo-PD. One patient underwent LAT, but other 8 patients did not because of a few micro-metastatic lesions (n\u202f=\u202f2), meningitis (n\u202f=\u202f1), no indication of pleurodesis (n\u202f=\u202f1), patient refusal (n\u202f=\u202f2) or oligo-PD in the LAT treated sites (n\u202f=\u202f3). Additional bevacizumab with continuation of the current EGFR-TKI had a disease control rate of 100% and a median time of progression-free survival from additional bevacizumab until another PD was 8.8 months. The reason for the discontinuation was because of another PD (n\u202f=\u202f6) or treatment-related adverse events (n\u202f=\u202f3). Four patients received sequential therapy and overall survival from additional bevacizumab was 10.1 months. CONCLUSIONS: Additional bevacizumab could be useful for EGFR-mutant adenocarcinoma patients with oligo-PD after the EGFR-TKI failure.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 431 patients with stage I-II MIESLC treated with SABR from 2009 through 2017. Age; sex; performance score; imaging technique; tumor histology and size; disease stage radiation dose, fraction and biologically effective dose with an alpha/beta ratio of 10 (BED(10) ); tumor location and treatment center were evaluated for associations with overall survival (OS), local control (LC) and toxicity. RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 27 months (range 1-115); median SABR dose was 54 Gy (range 30-70) given in a median three fractions (range 1-10); median BED(10) was 151 Gy (range 48-180). Tumors were peripheral in 285 patients (66.1%), central in 69 (16%) and <1 cm from mediastinal structures in 77 (17.9%). Response was evaluated with PET/CT in most cases at a median 3 months after SABR. Response rates were: 48% complete, 36.7% partial, 7.9% stable and 7.4% progression. LC rates were 97.1% at 1 year, 92.6% at 2 years and 91.2% at 3 years; corresponding OS rates were 92.6%, 80.6% and 72.7%. On multivariate analysis, BED(10) > 100 Gy (P = .011), adenocarcinoma (P = .025) and complete response on first evaluation (P = .007) predicted favorable LC. BED(10) > 120 Gy (hazard ratio [HR] 1.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-3.2, P = .019) and tumor size (<2 cm HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.3-3, P = .003) predicted favorable OS. No grade 4-5 acute side effects were observed; late effects were grade </=3 pneumonitis (18 [4.2%]), chest wall pain (11 [2.5%]) and rib fracture (1 [0.2%]). CONCLUSION: SABR produced encouraging results, with satisfactory LC and OS and minimal toxicity.

The Japanese journal of thoracic surgery\nPublication Date: 2018 Apr\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE: The outcome of surgical treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer after induction chemoradiotherapy was investigated. SUBJECTS: The subjects were 74 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer who received induction chemoradiotherapy( ICRT) between 1998 and 2016. ICRT was administered to pT3 lung cancer invading the chest wall(20 patients), pT4 lung cancer invading the adjacent organ(22 patients), and cN2 lung cancer(32 patients). cN2 was confirmed by mediastinoscopy(13 patients) and endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration(EBUS-TBNA)(19 patients). RESULTS: Sixty-eight and 6 patients were male and female, respectively, and the mean age was 59.6 years old. The histologic type was adenocarcinoma in 43 patients, squamous cell carcinoma in 24, adenosquamous carcinoma in 5, and others in 2. In chemotherapy, 2 or more anticancer drugs including platinum agent were administered. The radiation dosage was 36 Gy in 1 patient, 40 Gy in 43, 50 Gy in 28, and 60 Gy in 2. The effect of ICRT was complete response( CR) in 1 patient, partial response( PR) in 40, and stable disease (SD) in 33 (CR+PR:55.4%). The surgical procedure was lobectomy in 60 patients, pneumonectomy in 10, bilobectomy in 3, and segmentectomy in 1. Tracheobronchoplasty was performed in 9 patients, and combined resection of the vertebral body, left atrium, carina, superior vena cava, aorta, and brachiocephalic subclavian artery was performed in 7, 5, 4, 3, 3, and 3 patients, respectively. Regarding postoperative complications, empyema developed in 5 patients, acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS)in 3, pneumonia in 3, tracheobronchial dehiscence in 2, postoperative hemorrhage in 1, atrial fibrillation in 1, and others in 5. Postoperative complication rate was 27.0%, and operative death occurred due to postoperative hemorrhage in 1 patient. Complete resection was achieved in 69 patients(93.2%). Regarding the histological effect of ICRT, Ef.1/2/3 = 32/28/14(Ef.2-3:56.7%), and down stage was achieved in 24 patients (32.4%). The 5-year survival rate of all 74 patients was 51.0%, median survival time (MST)was 62.7 months, and the recurrence-free survival rate was 47.3%. Recurrence occurred in 28 patients (40.6%)with complete resection and the recurrence was distant metastasis in 20 of them. Regarding the outcome by the effect of ICRT, the 5-year survival rates of patients who achieved CR+PR/SD, Ef.2-3/Ef.0-1, and down stage/non-down stage were 66.0%/34.3%(p=0.009), 73.2%/20.1%(p=0.001), and 83.7%/44.0%(p=0.02), respectively, showing that the outcomes of patients who achieved CR/PR, Ef.2-3, and down stage were significantly favorable. CONCLUSION: The morbidity and mortality rates of patients who underwent surgery after ICRT were 27 and 1.4%, respectively. More than half of the patients achieved CR-PR and Ef.2-3, 1/3 of the cases were down staged, and the outcomes of these patients were significantly favorable. Surgery after ICRT may improve the treatment outcome of patients with locally advanced lung cancer.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 36386456\nTitle: Nintedanib plus docetaxel after progression on first-line immunochemotherapy in patients with lung adenocarcinoma: Cohort C of the non-interventional study, VARGADO.\nAuthors: Grohe C, Wehler T, Dechow T\nJournal: Translational lung cancer research\nPublication Date: 2022 Oct\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) with or without chemotherapy represent first-line standard of care for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without targetable driver mutations. The most appropriate second-line therapy after failing immunochemotherapy remains an open question. Nintedanib, an oral triple angiokinase inhibitor that targets the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, fibroblast growth factor receptor, and, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, in combination with docetaxel, is approved for treatment of advanced NSCLC (adenocarcinoma histology) following progression on first-line chemotherapy. METHODS: VARGADO (NCT02392455) is an ongoing, prospective, non-interventional study investigating the efficacy and safety of nintedanib plus docetaxel following first-line chemotherapy with or without ICIs in patients with locally advanced, metastatic, or locally recurrent NSCLC of adenocarcinoma histology. This analysis focuses on Cohort C, which enrolled patients who had received prior first line chemotherapy with ICIs. Patients received second-line docetaxel (75 mg/m(2)) by intravenous infusion on Day 1, plus oral nintedanib (200 mg twice daily) on Days 2-21 of each 21-day cycle during routine clinical care. The primary endpoint is overall survival (OS) rate 1 year after the start of treatment with nintedanib plus docetaxel. Secondary endpoints include progression-free survival (PFS), OS, and disease control rate (DCR). Safety was also assessed. RESULTS: Among 137 patients treated, the median age was 63 years (range, 37-84); 57 patients (41.6%) were female, most patients had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 (28.5%) or 1 (43.1%); 118 (86.1%) had stage IV NSCLC and 27 (19.7%) had brain metastases. Most (n=120, 87.6%) patients had received pembrolizumab/pemetrexed/platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line treatment. In 80 patients with available response data, the DCR was 72.5% (complete response: 1.3%; partial response: 36.3%; stable disease: 35.0%). Median progression-free survival was 4.8 months (95% confidence interval: 3.7-6.6). OS data were immature. Grade >/=3 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious TEAEs, and TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation were reported in 62 (45.3%), 50 (36.5%), and 40 patients (29.2%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis indicates that nintedanib plus docetaxel represents an effective second-line treatment option in patients with advanced adenocarcinoma NSCLC following progression on first-line immunochemotherapy. The safety profile was manageable with no unexpected signals.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
