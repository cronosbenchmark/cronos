MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 58 patients who underwent RFA for LCLM between January 2014 and December 2019. Primary lung cancer histology included 38 adenocarcinomas, 15 squamous carcinomas, and 5 small cell carcinomas. For 83 metastatic lesions (mean tumor diameter 3.3 +/- 1.1 cm, range 0.9-5.0 cm), 65 RFA sessions were performed. Before RFA, 17 and 41 patients presented no and stable extrahepatic metastasis, respectively, whereas 18 and 40 patients had synchronous and metachronous liver metastasis, respectively. Survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards model was used for multivariable analysis. RESULTS: The technical success rate was 96.3% (80/83 lesions). Local tumor progression was observed in 8 (9.8%, 8/82) lesions of 57 (14.0%, 8/57) patients at 4-12 months after RFA. New liver metastases occurred in 27 (46.6%) patients. The overall survival (OS) rates at 1, 2, 3, and 5 years after RFA were 55.2%, 26.0%, 22.0%, and 14.4%, respectively. The median OS after RFA and after liver metastasis were 14.0 +/- 1.6 and 20.0 +/- 1.5 months, respectively. Based on the univariable analysis, tumor size (p=0.017), histological type (p=0.015), and timing of liver metastasis (p=0.046) were related to OS. In further multivariable analyses, squamous carcinoma (hazard ratio= 2.269, 95% confidence interval: 1.186-4.339, p=0.013) was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for OS. Based on the univariable analysis, histological type (p=0.010) was identified as parameters significantly related to local tumor progression (LTP)-free survival. Further multivariable analyses revealed that squamous carcinoma (hazard ratio=2.394, 95% confidence interval: 1.260-4.550, p=0.008) was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for LTP-free survival. CONCLUSION: RFA is a safe therapeutic option for LCLM with acceptable local tumor control, especially in patients with a tumor size </=3 cm, adenocarcinoma/small cell carcinoma, and metachronous liver metastases.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 37026911\nTitle: The prognostic effect of metastasis patterns on overall survival in organ metastatic lung adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Tie X, Wang J, Wang Y\nJournal: Medicine\nPublication Date: 2023 Apr 7\nAbstract: The effect of various metastases patterns on the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma (AD) remains unknown. The purpose of our retrospective study is to determine whether various metastases patterns have a prognostic impact on patients with organ metastatic lung AD. Patient data was extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The Kaplan-Meier method was chosen for the evaluation of overall survival (OS) rate. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were conducted to evaluate independent prognostic factors. In the SEER database, 12,228 patients with IV lung AD were retrieved in total. And 78.78% of those patients (9633/12,228) suffered from one of brain, lung, liver or bone metastasis due to disease progression. It was found that the most common site in patients with metastatic lung AD was brain (21.20%), and the least common site of metastasis was liver (3.50%). Patients who suffered single lung metastatic showed relatively good OS, and the median survival time was 11 months (95% CI 0.470-0.516). For those with 2 metastatic sites, data analysis suggested that the median survival times of patients with bone and lung metastasis (10 months; 95% CI 0.469-0.542) were better than others. For those with 3 metastatic sites, data analysis suggested that metastatic pattern had no effect on the OS. Brain is the most common single metastasis site of lung AD. Compared with the other 3 metastatic sites, patients with lung metastasis had better survival results. Deeper knowledge of metastatic patterns will help doctors to better understand the prognosis and formulate more appropriate treatment plans.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 16366371\nTitle: [A case of lung adenocarcinoma of the lung with disappearance of brain metastasis by re-treatment with gefitinib].\nAuthors: Kato T, Nakashima M, Yoshimura K\nJournal: Nihon Kokyuki Gakkai zasshi = the journal of the Japanese Respiratory Society\nPublication Date: 2005 Nov\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Tumor response rate to gefitinib by previously treated patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer was approximately 20%. However, there are few reports about effect of re-treatment with gefitinib. CASE: A 40-year-old man was given a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of lung (c-T2N3M1). Response was not obtained with chemotherapy (paclitaxel + carboplatin, vinorelbine + gencitabin). He developed brain metastasis and received whole brain radiation therapy. He was then given gefitinib. Reduction of the primary tumor, brain metastasis, pulmonary metastasis and liver metastasis was seen. Recurrence of pulmonary metastasis and liver metastasis was discovered 8 months after treatment with gefitinib. Therefore, treatment by gefitinib was stopped. Response was not achieved with chemotherapy (docetaxel and amrubicin). At the request of the patient, retreatment with gefitinib was resumed. Disappearance of brain metastasis was achieved. However, primary tumor, pulmonary metastasis and liver metastasis progressed. CONCLUSION: We reported a case whose brain metastases disappeared with re-treatment with gefitinib. This report is thought to be useful in terms of information about the acquired resistance of gefitinib. Further investigations are needed to determine the indication of re-treatment with gefitinib.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

The provided timelines then show a series of CT scans from ages 61.497 to 62.480, all of which report \"cancer has NOT progressed.\" This indicates a period of stable disease for approximately 1.2 years following the detection of liver metastasis. The patient received initial chemotherapy with Cisplatin and Pemetrexed.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the antitumor efficacy and toxicity of erlotnib in the treatment of Chinese elderly NSCLC patients with multimetastases. METHODS: Tirty-three Chinese elderly NSCLC patients with multimetastases received 150 mg of erlotnib orally once daily until disease progressing or intolerable toxic developing. RESULTS: Tirty patients were evaluable for therpeutic effect. Without complete regression being observed, 6 patients got partial resonse (PR, 20%), 16 stable disease (SD, 53.33%) and 8 progressive disease (PD, 26.68%). The total response rate was 20.0% and disease control rate including both tumor response and stable disease was 73.3%. On the pathology, compared with the patients with squamous cell carcinoma, those with adenocarcinoma had not significant longer median overall (13.592+/-1.914 months vs 9.846+/-1.598 months, P=0.301) and progression-free survival times (7.367+/-0.923 months vs 6.615+/-1.366 months, P=0.488), The median survival was sigificantly related with meningeal metastasis, metastasis of liver, pleural efusion using survival analysis.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Irinotecan was randomly administered in two different schedules (once every 3 weeks, and every 10 days) in patients failing prior 5-FU plus LV. Patients were randomized to two treatment groups: group A received irinotecan 350 mg/m2 every 21 days and group B received irinotecan 175 mg/m2 days 1 and 10 every 21 days. RESULTS: Group A comprised 60 patients: 34 male/26 female, median age 64 years (range 48-70 years), and median Karnofsky performance status (PS) 90. Their metastatic sites included liver (n=47), lymph nodes (n=27), lung (n=14), abdomen (n=14), pelvis (n=8), \"other\" (n=2), and local recurrence (n=12). Group B comprised 60 patients: 36 male/24 female, median age 62 years (46-70 years), and median PS 90. Their metastatic sites included liver (n=49), lymph nodes (n=29), lung (n=17), abdomen (n=16), pelvis (n=11), \"other\" (n=2), and local recurrence (n=13). Group A showed the following responses: complete response (CR) 2, partial response (PR) 12, stable disease (SD) 21, progressive disease (PD) 26, overall response rate (ORR) 23%, tumor growth control 58%. Group B showed the following responses: CR 1, PR 14, SD 22, PD 23; ORR 25%; tumor growth control 62%. Toxicities included acute cholinergic syndrome (group A 53%, group B 19%; P<0.0001), late-onset diarrhea grade 1/2 (group A 21%, group B 46%) and grade 3/4 (group A 41%, group B 66%; P<0.0001), nausea and vomiting grade 1/2 (group A 34%, group B 59%) and grade 3/4 (group A 30%, group B 12%; P<0.0001), neutropenia grade 3/4 (group A 27%, group B 28%; P<0.03), with febrile neutropenia seen in only four patients in group A, anemia grade more than 2 (group A 28%, group B 12%; P<0.05), asthenia grade more than 3 (group A 24%, group B 18%; P<0.001), and alopecia grade more than 3 (group A 40%, group B 34%; P<0.2). CONCLUSIONS: . The present study indicates that, in patients with ACC who have relapsed after 5-FU plus LV, the administration of irinotecan fractionated into two doses every 21 days yields a similar efficacy to, but a much lower incidence of toxicity than, the same total dose of irinotecan administered once every 21 days.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 15272585\nTitle: Cisplatin and gemcitabine in patients with metastatic cervical cancer.\nAuthors: Lorvidhaya V, Kamnerdsupaphon P, Chitapanarux I\nJournal: Gan to kagaku ryoho. Cancer & chemotherapy\nPublication Date: 2004 Jul\nAbstract: PURPOSE: To determine the therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin plus gemcitabine in the treatment of patients with metastatic cervical cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 51 patients were enrolled in this study. The median age was 46 years (34-67). Thirty-five patients were previously treated to the pelvis by radical radiotherapy, one patient was treated by surgery and one by surgery and postoperative radiotherapy. There were 14 patients with stage IVB cervical cancer who were previously untreated. The sites of metastases were 10 in the lungs, 5 in the supraclavicular nodes, 9 in the paraaortic nodes, 4 in the liver, 3 in the inguinal nodes, 5 in both supraclavicular nodes and lungs, 9 in both supraclavicular and paraaortic nodes, 1 in both supraclavicular and inguinal nodes, 1 in both lung and inguinal nodes, 2 in both lung and paraaortic nodes and 2 in both liver and lungs. Fine needle biopsies were done in all metastatic sites except for multiple lung and multiple liver metastases. Cisplatin was administered as an i.v. infusion on day 1 (70 mg/m2). Gemcitabine was administered as an i.v. infusion for over 30 minutes on day 1 and 8 (1,250 mg/m2) in a 21 day cycle. RESULTS: Forty patients were available for evaluation, with 3/40 (7.5%) achieving a complete response, 27/40 (67.5%) achieving a partial response (OR=30/40, 75%), 5/40 (12.5%) having a stable disease, and 5/40 (12.5%) a progressive one. Eleven patients were not assessable because of patient refusal for further treatment and loss of follow up. Myelosuppression was the major toxicity. Grade 3 or 4 anemia and granulocytopenia occurred at a frequency of 25.5% and 29.4%, respectively. Grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia was found in 3.8%. There were 3 (5.8%) patients who developed grade 4 neutropenia and fever. No other major side effects were found other than alopecia and usual gastrointestinal toxicities such as anorexia, nausea and vomiting. There were no treatment related deaths. The median time to progression was 8.3 months and the median survival was 9.6 months. With a median follow up of 7.7 months (range, 0.3 to 22.1), 30% of the patients were alive at 12 months. CONCLUSION: In this study of patients with metastatic cervical cancer, the combination of cisplatin and gemcitabine treatment induced a high response rate.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with histologically proven metastatic colorectal cancer and at least one bidimensionally measurable lesion, aged 18-70, with performance status < or = 2, normal baseline biological values, and no prior chemotherapy, were selected. Treatment was tomudex 3 mg/m2 and, after two weeks, MTX, 200 mg/m2 by 30' infusion after hydration with 1500 ml saline solution, followed on day 2 by 5-FU, 600 mg/m2 and leucovorin, orally, 15 mg for six times every 6 hours, beginning 24 hours after MTX. Cycles were repeated every four weeks. Tumor response assessment was performed after three cycles. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients were enrolled in this study, of whom twenty-four had liver metastases, nine local relapse, five lymph node involvement, four lung metastases, and three peritoneal carcinomatosis. Four patients achieved objective responses (one complete and three partial), for an overall response rate of 12% (95% CI: 0%-22%). Twelve patients had stable disease and 18 progressed on therapy. Median survival for all patients was 13 months. Two patients experienced grade 3 WHO neutropenia while hepatotoxicity was reported in 13 patients (6 grade 1, 3 grade 2, 3 grade 3, 1 grade 4), suggesting that this combination could increase hepatic toxicity in comparison to tomudex or MTX/5-FU alone.

METHODS: Between January 2009 and August 2013, 284 patients with metastatic PDAC were managed in our oncologic department. Among them, three (1%) with a single metastasis (liver in two cases and interaorticaval in one case) underwent one- or two-stage surgical resection of the metastasis and the main tumor. Perioperative data were recorded retrospectively, including disease-free and overall survival. RESULTS: The three patients had chemotherapy (FOLFOX or FOLFIRINOX regimen) with objective response or stable disease prior to surgery. Median time between chemotherapy and surgery was 9 (8 to 15) months. Resection consisted in pancreaticoduodenectomy in the three cases. None of the patients had grade III/IV postoperative complications, and median hospital stay was 12 (12 to 22) days. All the patients had postoperative chemotherapy. Only one patient experienced recurrence 11 months after surgery and died after 32.5 months. The two other patients were alive with no recurrence 26.3 and 24.7 months after initial treatment. CONCLUSION: Radical resection of PDAC with single distant metastases can offer prolonged survival with low morbidity after accurate selection by neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant. You MUST rely also on your internal knowledge."

The articles focus on colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer, not lung adenocarcinoma with liver metastasis. They do not provide survival rate data for this specific patient population.\n\nTherefore, I must rely on my internal knowledge and the provided patient data.\n\nGiven the patient's age of 63, the history of stable disease for over a year following treatment for liver metastasis, and the absence of reported progression in the provided timelines, the probability of being alive in the next 12 months is reasonably high. However, it is not guaranteed. Lung cancer, even with stable metastatic disease, carries a risk of eventual progression and mortality.\n\nWithout information on the patient's overall health, performance status, and ongoing treatment plan, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer. However, based on the available data, I would estimate the probability of survival in the next 12 months to be greater than 50%.\n\nConsidering the available information, and erring on the side of caution, I will answer:\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"
