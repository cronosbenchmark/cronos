platinum-based chemotherapy drug in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nYttrium Y-90: Yttrium 90 has been investigated for the treatment of Colon Cancer and Colorectal Cancer.\n]\n"

The upfront exposure to three cytotoxics raises concerns about the efficacy of treatments after progression. METHODS: We performed a pooled analysis of treatments after progression to upfront FOLFOXIRI/bev in patients enrolled in two randomised Phase 3 studies (TRIBE and TRIBE2) that compared FOLFOXIRI/bev to doublets (FOLFOX or FOLFIRI)/bev. Response rate, progression-free survival (2nd PFS) and overall survival (2nd OS) during treatments after progression were assessed. The RECIST response in first line and the oxaliplatin and irinotecan-free interval (OIFI) were investigated as potential predictors of benefit from FOLFOXIRI +/- bev reintroduction. RESULTS: Longer 2nd PFS was reported in patients receiving FOLFOXIRI +/- bev reintroduction compared to doublets +/- bev or other treatments (6.1 versus 4.4 and 3.9 months, respectively, P = 0.013), and seems limited to patients achieving a response during first line (6.9 versus 4.2 and 4.7 months, respectively, P = 0.005) and an OIFI >/= 4 months (7.2 versus 6.5 and 4.6 months, respectively, P = 0.045). CONCLUSIONS: First-line FOLFOXIRI/bev does not impair the administration of effective second-line therapies.

Oncology\nPublication Date: 2020 Apr\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: The triplet FOLFOXIRI (fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan) plus bevacizumab showed improved outcomes for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, compared with FOLFIRI (fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan) plus bevacizumab. However, the actual benefit of the upfront exposure to the three cytotoxic drugs compared with a preplanned sequential strategy of doublets was not clear, and neither was the feasibility or efficacy of therapies after disease progression. We aimed to compare a preplanned strategy of upfront FOLFOXIRI followed by the reintroduction of the same regimen after disease progression versus a sequence of mFOLFOX6 (fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) and FOLFIRI doublets, in combination with bevacizumab. METHODS: TRIBE2 was an open-label, phase 3, randomised study of patients aged 18-75 years with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 2, with unresectable, previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer, recruited from 58 Italian oncology units. Patients were stratified according to centre, ECOG performance status, primary tumour location, and previous adjuvant chemotherapy. A randomisation system incorporating a minimisation algorithm was used to randomly assign patients (1:1) via a masked web-based allocation procedure to two different treatment strategies. In the control group, patients received first-line mFOLFOX6 (85 mg/m(2) of intravenous oxaliplatin concurrently with 200 mg/m(2) of leucovorin over 120 min; 400 mg/m(2) intravenous bolus of fluorouracil; 2400 mg/m(2) continuous infusion of fluorouracil for 48 h) plus bevacizumab (5 mg/kg intravenously over 30 min) followed by FOLFIRI (180 mg/m(2) of intravenous irinotecan over 120 min concurrently with 200 mg/m(2) of leucovorin; 400 mg/m(2) intravenous bolus of fluorouracil; 2400 mg/m(2) continuous infusion of fluorouracil for 48 h) plus bevacizumab after disease progression. In the experimental group, patients received FOLFOXIRI (165 mg/m(2) of intravenous irinotecan over 60 min; 85 mg/m(2) intravenous oxaliplatin concurrently with 200 mg/m(2) of leucovorin over 120 min; 3200 mg/m(2) continuous infusion of fluorouracil for 48 h) plus bevacizumab followed by the reintroduction of the same regimen after disease progression. Combination treatments were repeated every 14 days for up to eight cycles followed by fluorouracil and leucovorin (at the same dose administered at the last induction cycle) plus bevacizumab maintenance until disease progression, unacceptable adverse events, or consent withdrawal. Patients and investigators were not masked. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival 2, defined as the time from randomisation to disease progression on any treatment given after first disease progression, or death, analysed by intention to treat. Safety was assessed in patients who received at least one dose of their assigned treatment. Study recruitment is complete and follow-up is ongoing. This trial is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02339116. FINDINGS: Between Feb 26, 2015, and May 15, 2017, 679 patients were randomly assigned and received treatment (340 in the control group and 339 in the experimental group). At data cut-off (July 30, 2019) median follow-up was 35.9 months (IQR 30.1-41.4). Median progression-free survival 2 was 19.2 months (95% CI 17.3-21.4) in the experimental group and 16.4 months (15.1-17.5) in the control group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.74, 95% CI 0.63-0.88; p=0.0005). During the first-line treatment, the most frequent of all-cause grade 3-4 events were diarrhoea (57 [17%] vs 18 [5%]), neutropenia (168 [50%] vs 71 [21%]), and arterial hypertension (25 [7%] vs 35 [10%]) in the experimental group compared with the control group. Serious adverse events occurred in 84 (25%) patients in the experimental group and in 56 (17%) patients in the control group. Eight treatment-related deaths were reported in the experimental group (two intestinal occlusions, two intestinal perforations, two sepsis, one myocardial infarction, and one bleeding) and four in the control group (two occlusions, one perforation, and one pulmonary embolism). After first disease progression, no substantial differences in the incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse events were reported between the control and experimental groups, with the exception of neurotoxicity, which was only reported in the experimental group (six [5%] of 132 patients). Serious adverse events after disease progression occurred in 20 (15%) patients in the experimental group and 25 (12%) in the control group. Three treatment-related deaths after first disease progression were reported in the experimental group (two intestinal occlusions and one sepsis) and four in the control group (one intestinal occlusion, one intestinal perforation, one cerebrovascular event, and one sepsis). INTERPRETATION: Upfront FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab followed by the reintroduction of the same regimen after disease progression seems to be a preferable therapeutic strategy to sequential administration of chemotherapy doublets, in combination with bevacizumab, for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer selected according to the study criteria.

Our phase III study investigated the effect of introducing earlier (second-line) or later (third-line) cetuximab in patients progressed after FOLFIRI/bevacizumab first-line. PATIENTS AND METHODS: mCRC patients progressing after FOLFIRI/bevacizumab first-line were randomised to receive second-line irinotecan/cetuximab followed by third-line FOLFOX-4 (arm A) or the reverse sequence (arm B). Primary end-point was progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: About 54 and 56 patients were randomised in arm A and in arm B, respectively. After a median follow-up of 37.5 months, 100 PFS events were recorded. Median PFS was 9.9 months in arm A and 11.3 months in arm B (Hazard ratio [HR] 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69-1.56, p = 0.854), while median overall survival was 12.3 months in arm A and 18.6 months in arm B (HR 0.84, 95% CI: 0.55-1.28; p = 0.411). No overall difference in side-effects were observed between the two treatment arms. CONCLUSIONS: This trial did not meet the primary end-point (PFS). Like other preclinical and clinical evidences, our study seems to suggest a reduced activity of cetuximab after a first-line bevacizumab-based therapy.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

To estimate the prognostic impact of these chemotherapies, we examined the chronological change in survival rates of patients who underwent pulmonary metastasectomy for colorectal cancer metastasis. METHODS: Using a large database, we conducted a retrospective, multi-institutional study to collect data of 1223 eligible patients from 26 institutions who had undergone pulmonary metastasectomy with curative intent. We divided those patients who underwent metastasectomy in different time periods according to the major trend of chemotherapy regimens for recurrent colorectal cancer: those who underwent metastasectomy between 1990 and 1999 ( N  = 451, Group A), between 2000 and 2004 ( N  = 433, Group B) or between 2005 and 2007 ( N  = 339, Group C). RESULTS: Five-year overall survival rates after metastasectomy were 45% in Group A, 56% in Group B and 66% in Group C ( P  < 0.0001) whereas rates after metastasectomy plus chemotherapy were 32% in Group A, 47% in Group B and 70% in Group C ( P  = 0.0059). The prognosis of patients who underwent both metastasectomy and chemotherapy in Group C was significantly better than that of the other two groups. Overall survival of patients who did not receive chemotherapy was not significantly different between the groups. CONCLUSION: Survival rates of patients after pulmonary metastasectomy for colorectal cancer metastasis who underwent chemotherapy have increased over the years. It implies that newer chemotherapy regimens might have had a positive impact on these patients.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 32277634\nTitle: Survival of patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer treated with bevacizumab and FOLFOX4.\nAuthors: Dzunic M, Andjelkovic-Apostolovic M, Vrbic S\nJournal: Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology\nPublication Date: 2020 Jan-Feb\nAbstract: Purpose: In patients with colorectal liver metastases (CLM) a long term survival and a probability of cure might be achieved with the surgical treatment of metastatic sites after prior application of systemic treatment. The purpose of this study was to assess the survival of patients with unresectable CLM treated with bevacizumab (bev) and FOLFOX4 (FOLFOX-bev) and to compare survival according to patient, disease and treatment characteristics. Methods: This research included 110 patients with unresectable CLM treated with FOLFOX-bev. Treatment response and resectability were estimated every 3 months. If resectability was achieved, patients were operated on and followed. Patient, disease and treatment characteristics in patients with and without hepatectomy were compared. Survival was estimated according to Kaplan-Meier method. Comparison of survival according to patient, disease and treatment characteristics was performed using log-rank test. Results: In patients with hepatectomy, treatment response was significantly more frequent (63, 63% vs 16, 66%, p<0.001). One- and three-year survival rate for the whole group was 87, 3% and 36, 1%, respectively; median overall survival (OS) was 23 months (95%CI 19, 63-28, 26). One- and three-year survival for patients with hepatectomy was 98, 48%, and 54, 76%, respectively; median OS was 35 months (95%CI 28, 83-41, 17). Three-year survival was significantly better in patients with hepatectomy (HR=3.775; 95%CI 2.150-6.627, p<0.001), older than 60 years (p=0.033), those without extrahepatic metastases (p=0.008) and those with treatment response (p=0.05).

Through the biochemical modulation of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with folinic acid (FA), the use of infusional rather than bolus regimens and the combination of 5-FU/FA with other active agents (notably irinotecan), first-line response rates (RRs) of 40% can be achieved, with patients surviving up to 17 months. Significant benefits on survival are also seen with second-line chemotherapy. The question of how best to sequence combination chemotherapy was addressed in a recent trial in which patients were randomized to receive either an irinotecan-based combination with 5-FU/FA (FOLFIRI) followed by an oxaliplatin-based combination (FOLFOX), or the two regimens in the reverse order. In both arms, RRs were greater than 50% and median survival exceeded 20 months. The primary end point was time to progression after two lines of treatment, and this was not significantly different. However, the sequence FOLFIRI followed by FOLFOX appears preferable because of the better tolerability of FOLFIRI in first-line use. Use of the sequence FOLFIRI/FOLFOX is also supported by the greater chance of a second-line response with FOLFOX. Concern has been expressed about the safety of irinotecan combined with bolus 5-FU/FA. Infusional regimens have a better risk/benefit ratio than bolus regimens. However, the adverse event profile with both approaches is manageable, and irinotecan plus 5-FU/FA can be considered one standard of care in metastatic CRC.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
