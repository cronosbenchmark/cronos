Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

Clinical data analysis plays a crucial role in predicting the survival of colorectal cancer patients, enabling clinicians to make informed treatment decisions. However, utilizing clinical data can be challenging, especially when dealing with imbalanced outcomes, an aspect often overlooked in this context. This paper focuses on developing algorithms to predict 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival of colorectal cancer patients using clinical datasets, with particular emphasis on the highly imbalanced 1-year survival prediction task. We utilized a colorectal cancer dataset from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, which exhibits high imbalance in the 1-year (1:10) survival analysis and an imbalance in the 3-year (2:10) analysis, achieving balance in the 5-year analysis. The pre-processing step consists of removing records with missing values and merging categories with less than 2% share for each categorical feature to limit the number of classes of each component. Edited Nearest Neighbor, Repeated Edited Nearest Neighbor (RENN), Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), and pipelines of SMOTE and RENN approaches were used for balancing the data with tree-based classifiers, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extra Tree, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM). The performance evaluation utilizes a 5-fold cross-validation approach. In the case of 1-year, our proposed method with LGBM significantly outperforms other sampling methods with the sensitivity of 72.30%. For the task of 3-year survival, the combination of RENN and LGBM achieves a sensitivity of 80.81%, indicating that our proposed method works best for highly imbalanced datasets. Additionally, when predicting 5-year survival, the sensitivity reaches 63.03% using LGBM. Our proposed method significantly improves mortality prediction for the minority class of colorectal cancer patients. RENN followed by SMOTE yields better sensitivity in the classifiers, with LGBM as the predictor performing best for 1- and 3-year survival. In the 5-year task, LGBM outperforms other models in terms of F1-score.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 36842345\nTitle: Artificial intelligence based personalized predictive survival among colorectal cancer patients.\nAuthors: Susic D, Syed-Abdul S, Dovgan E\nJournal: Computer methods and programs in biomedicine\nPublication Date: 2023 Apr\nAbstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Colorectal cancer is a major health concern. It is now the third most common cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms for predicting survival of colorectal cancer patients 1 to 5 years after diagnosis, and identify the most important variables. METHODS: A sample of 1236 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer and 118 predictor variables has been used. The outcome of interest was a binary variable indicating whether the patient survived the number of years in question or not. 20 predictor variables were selected using mutual information score with the outcome. We implemented 11 machine learning algorithms and evaluated their performance with a 5 by 2-fold cross-validation with stratified folds and with paired Student's t-tests. We compared the results with the Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox's proportional hazard regression. RESULTS: Using the 20 most important predictor variables for each of the survival years, the logistic regression algorithm achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.850 (0.014 SD, 0.840-0.860 95 % CI) for the 1-year, and 0.872 (0.014 SD, 0.861-0.882 95% CI) for the 5-year survival prediction. Using only the 5 most important predictor variables, the corresponding values are 0.793 (0.020 SD, 0.778-0.807 95% CI) and 0.794 (0.011 SD, 0.785-0.802 95% CI). The most important variables for 1-year prediction were number of R residual, M distant metastasis, overall stage, probable recurrence within 5 years, and tumour length, whereas for 5-year prediction the most important were probable recurrence within 5 years, R residual, M distant metastasis, number of positive lymph nodes, and palliative chemotherapy. Biomarkers do not appear among the top 20 most important ones. For all survival intervals, the probability of the top model agrees with the Kaplan-Meier estimate, both in the interval of one standard deviation and in the 95% confidence interval. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that machine learning algorithms can predict the survival probability of colorectal cancer patients and can be used to inform the patients and assist decision-making in clinical care management. In addition, this study unveils the most essential variables for estimating survival short- and long-term among patients with Colorectal cancer.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 31868876\nTitle: Development and validation of nomograms for prediction of overall survival and cancer-specific survival of patients of colorectal cancer.\nAuthors: Zhang J, Yang Y, Fu X\nJournal: Japanese journal of clinical oncology\nPublication Date: 2020 Mar 9\nAbstract: PURPOSE: Nomograms are intuitive tools for individualized cancer prognosis. We sought to develop a clinical nomogram for prediction of overall survival and cancer-specific survival for patients with colorectal cancer. METHODS: Patients with colorectal cancer diagnosed between 1988 and 2006 and those who underwent surgery were retrieved from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database and randomly divided into the training (n = 119 797) and validation (n = 119 797) cohorts. Log-rank and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used in our analysis. To find out death from other cancer causes and non-cancer causes, a competing-risks model was used, based on which we integrated these significant prognostic factors into nomograms and subjected the nomograms to bootstrap internal validation and to external validation. RESULTS: The 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year probabilities of overall survival in patients of colorectal cancer after surgery intervention were 83.04, 65.54, 54.79 and 38.62%, respectively. The 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year cancer-specific survival was 87.36, 73.44, 66.22 and 59.11%, respectively. Nine independent prognostic factors for overall survival and nine independent prognostic factors for cancer specific survival were included to build the nomograms. Internal and external validation CI indexes of overall survival were 0.722 and 0.721, and those of cancer-specific survival were 0.765 and 0.766, which was satisfactory. CONCLUSIONS: Nomograms for prediction of overall survival and cancer-specific survival of patients with colorectal cancer. Performance of the model was excellent. This practical prognostic model may help clinicians in decision-making and design of clinical studies.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
