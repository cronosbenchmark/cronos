9-residue peptide analogue of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Unlike the endogenous decapeptide GnRH, leuprolide contains a single D-amino acid (D-leucyl) residue, which helps to increase its circulating half-life from three to four minutes to approximately three hours.[A203222] As a GnRH mimic, leuprolide is capable of binding to the GnRH receptor (GnRHR) and inducing downstream modulation of both gonadotropin hormone and sex steroid levels. Prolonged activation of GnRHR results in significant downregulation of sex steroid levels, which is primarily responsible for the clinical efficacy of leuprolide in diverse conditions, including advanced prostate cancer, endometriosis, and central precocious puberty.[A203126, A203132]\r\n\r\nLeuprolide was first approved in 1985 as a daily subcutaneous injection under the tradename Lupron\u2122 by Abbvie Endocrine Inc.[L13850] Since this initial approval, various long-acting intramuscular and subcutaneous products have been developed such that patients can be dosed once every six months.[L13781, L13790] Leuprolide remains frontline therapy in all conditions for which it is indicated for use.\nBicalutamide: Bicalutamide is an oral non-steroidal anti-androgen for prostate cancer. It is comprised of a racemic mixture that is a 50:50 composition of the (R)-bicalutamide and (S)-bicalutamide enantionmers. Bicalutamide binds to the androgen receptor.\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

Peripheral blood circulating tumor cell (CTC) count is the most extensively validated prognostic liquid biomarker in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), and recent studies have suggested that it may also be informative in mHSPC. OBJECTIVE: To examine the prognostic value of CTC count in men with mHSPC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this prognostic study, peripheral blood was drawn at registration (baseline) and at progression to mCRPC in the S1216 study (March 1, 2013, to July 15, 2017), a phase 3, prospective, randomized clinical trial in men with mHSPC. The CTCs were enumerated using a US Food and Drug Administration-cleared isolation platform. Counts were categorized as 0, 1 to 4, or 5 or more CTCs per 7.5 mL based on the prognostic value of these cut points in prior studies. The data analysis was performed between October 28, 2022, and June 15, 2023. EXPOSURE: Metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Circulating tumor cell count was evaluated for an association with 3 prespecified trial end points: OS, progression-free survival, and 7-month prostate-specific antigen, after adjusting for other baseline covariates using proportional hazards and logistic regression models. RESULTS: Of 1313 S1216 participants (median [IQR] age, 68 [44-92] years), evaluable samples from 503 (median [IQR] age, 69 [46-90] years) with newly diagnosed mHSPC were collected at baseline, and 93 samples were collected at progression. Baseline counts were 5 or more CTCs per 7.5 mL in 60 samples (11.9%), 1 to 4 CTCs per 7.5 mL in 107 samples (21.3%), and 0 CTCs per 7.5 mL in 336 samples (66.8%). Median OS for men with 5 or more CTCs per 7.5 mL was 27.9 months (95% CI, 24.1-31.2 months) compared with 56.2 months (95% CI, 45.7-69.8 months) for men with 1 to 4 CTCs per 7.5 mL and not reached at 78.0 months follow-up for men with 0 CTCs per 7.5 mL. After adjusting for baseline clinical covariates, men with 5 or more CTCs per 7.5 mL at baseline had a significantly higher hazard of death (hazard ratio, 3.22; 95% CI, 2.22-4.68) and disease progression (hazard ratio, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.76-3.43) and a lower likelihood of prostate-specific antigen complete response (odds ratio, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.12-0.54) compared with men with 0 CTCs per 7.5 mL at baseline. Adding baseline CTC count to other known prognostic factors (covariates only: area under the curve, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.67-0.79) resulted in an increased prognostic value for 3-year survival (area under the curve, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.73-0.84). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this prognostic study, the findings validate CTC count as a prognostic biomarker that improved upon existing prognostic factors and estimated vastly divergent survival outcomes regardless of subsequent lines of therapy. As such, baseline CTC count in mHSPC may serve as a valuable noninvasive biomarker to identify men likely to have poor survival who may benefit from clinical trials of intensified or novel regimens.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 29707790\nTitle: Time of metastatic disease presentation and volume of disease are prognostic for metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC).\nAuthors: Francini E, Gray KP, Xie W\nJournal: The Prostate\nPublication Date: 2018 Sep\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Currently, there is no universally accepted prognostic classification for patients (pts) with metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Subgroup analyses demonstrated that pts with low volume (LV), per CHAARTED trial definition, mHSPC, and those who relapse after prior local therapy (PLT) have longer overall survival (OS) compared to high volume (HV) and de-novo (DN), respectively. Using a hospital-based registry, we aimed to assess whether a classification based on time of metastatic disease (PLT vs DN) and disease volume (LV vs HV) are prognostic for mHSPC pts treated with ADT. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of consecutive patients with mHSPC treated with ADT between 1990 and 2013 was selected from the prospectively collected Dana-Farber Cancer Institute database and categorized as DN or PLT and HV or LV, at time of ADT start. Primary and secondary endpoints were OS and time to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), respectively, which were measured from date of ADT start using Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models using known prognostic factors was used. RESULTS: The analytical cohort consisted of 436 patients. The median OS and time to CRPC for PLT/LV were 92.4 (95%CI: 80.4-127.2) and 25.6 (95%CI: 21-35.7) months and 43.2 (95%CI: 37.2-56.4) and 12.2 (95%CI: 9.8-14.8) months for DN/HV, respectively, whereas intermediate values were observed for PLT/HV and DN/LV. A robust gradient for both outcomes was observed (Trend test P < 0.0001) in the four groups. In a multivariable analysis, DN presentation, HV, and cancer-related pain were independent prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: In our hospital-based registry, time of metastatic presentation and disease volume were prognostic for mHSPC pts treated with ADT. This simple prognostic classification system can aid patient counseling and future trial design.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 38887300\nTitle: Increased circulating polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells are associated with prognosis of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.\nAuthors: Kobayashi T, Nagata M, Hachiya T\nJournal: Frontiers in immunology\nPublication Date: 2024\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION: Myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) exhibits immunosuppressive functions and affects cancer progression, but its relationship with prostate cancer remains unclear. We elucidated the association of polymorphonuclear MDSC (PMN-MDSC) and monocytic MDSC (M-MDSC) levels of the total peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with prostate cancer progression and evaluated their roles as prognostic indicators. METHODS: We enrolled 115 patients with non-metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (nmHSPC, n = 62), metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC, n = 23), and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC, n = 30). Subsequently, the proportions of MDSCs in each disease progression were compared. Log-rank tests and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to ascertain the associations of overall survival. RESULTS: The patients with mCRPC had significantly higher PMN-MDSC percentage than those with nmHSPC and mHSPC (P = 7.73 x 10(-5) and 0.0014). Significantly elevated M-MDSC levels were observed in mCRPC patients aged <70 years (P = 0.016) and with a body mass index (BMI) <25 kg/m(2) (P = 0.043). The high PMN-MDSC group had notably shorter median survival duration (159 days) than the low PMN-MDSC group (768 days, log-rank P = 0.018). In the multivariate analysis including age, BMI, and MDSC subset, PMN-MDSC was significantly associated with prognosis (hazard ratios, 3.48; 95% confidence interval: 1.05-11.56, P = 0.042). DISCUSSION: PMN-MDSC levels are significantly associated with mCRPC prognosis. Additionally, we highlight the remarkable associations of age and BMI with M-MDSC levels in mCRPC, offering novel insights into MDSC dynamics in prostate cancer progression.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

While we don't have the CTC count for this patient, the study reinforces the idea that biomarkers can predict outcomes.\n    *   **Article #2 (Francini et al., 2018):** Shows that time of metastatic presentation (de novo vs. post-treatment) and disease volume are prognostic factors. This patient had a de novo metastatic presentation, which is generally associated with a worse prognosis.\n    *   **Article #3 (Kobayashi et al., 2024):** Demonstrates the association between increased myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and prognosis in mCRPC, suggesting immune dysfunction contributes to progression.\n\n*   **Recent Stability is Not Guarantee:** While the most recent scans (age 80.015) show no evidence of progression, this is a snapshot in time. The history of progression suggests the cancer remains capable of advancing.\n\nGiven the patient's age, prior progression, and the evidence from the literature, the risk of progression within the next 24 months is substantial.\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"

Prescription medications may risk-stratify patients independent of established methods, such as the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and guide treatment selection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a nationwide retrospective study of US Veterans, we used multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard modeling to evaluate the association between number and class of prescription medications and overall survival (OS) with age, race, body-mass index, prostate specific antigen (PSA), and Charlson comorbidities as covariates in veterans treated for de novo metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) between 2010-2021. RESULTS: Among 8,434 Veterans, a median of nine medications and five medication classes were filled in the year prior to initial treatment with abiraterone or enzalutamide for mHSPC. Veterans on 1-4 medications had an average survival of 38 months compared to 5-9 medicines (33 months), 10-14 medicines (27 months), and 15+ medicines (22 months) (p<0.001). After adjusting for age, race, body mass index (BMI), PSA, CCI, and year of diagnosis, both the number of medications and medication classes were associated with increased mortality. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] was 1.03 (1.02-1.03) for the number of medications and 1.05 (1.04-1.07) for medication classes. Medications within ATC B (blood/blood forming organs), ATC C (cardiovascular), and ATC N (nervous) were associated with worse OS, with aHRs of 1.14 (1.07, 1.21), 1.14 (1.06, 1.22), and 1.12 (1.06, 1.19), respectively. CONCLUSION: The number and class of medications were independently associated with overall survival in patients undergoing treatment for mHSPC. With new therapies for advanced prostate cancer, patients are living longer, highlighting the need for a better understanding of the impact of comorbid diseases. Simple methods to assess disease burden and prognosticate survival have the potential to guide treatment decisions.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 26244877\nTitle: Chemohormonal Therapy in Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer.\nAuthors: Sweeney CJ, Chen YH, Carducci M\nJournal: The New England journal of medicine\nPublication Date: 2015 Aug 20\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) has been the backbone of treatment for metastatic prostate cancer since the 1940s. We assessed whether concomitant treatment with ADT plus docetaxel would result in longer overall survival than that with ADT alone. METHODS: We assigned men with metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer to receive either ADT plus docetaxel (at a dose of 75 mg per square meter of body-surface area every 3 weeks for six cycles) or ADT alone. The primary objective was to test the hypothesis that the median overall survival would be 33.3% longer among patients receiving docetaxel added to ADT early during therapy than among patients receiving ADT alone. RESULTS: A total of 790 patients (median age, 63 years) underwent randomization. After a median follow-up of 28.9 months, the median overall survival was 13.6 months longer with ADT plus docetaxel (combination therapy) than with ADT alone (57.6 months vs. 44.0 months; hazard ratio for death in the combination group, 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.47 to 0.80; P<0.001). The median time to biochemical, symptomatic, or radiographic progression was 20.2 months in the combination group, as compared with 11.7 months in the ADT-alone group (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.72; P<0.001). The rate of a prostate-specific antigen level of less than 0.2 ng per milliliter at 12 months was 27.7% in the combination group versus 16.8% in the ADT-alone group (P<0.001). In the combination group, the rate of grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia was 6.2%, the rate of grade 3 or 4 infection with neutropenia was 2.3%, and the rate of grade 3 sensory neuropathy and of grade 3 motor neuropathy was 0.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Six cycles of docetaxel at the beginning of ADT for metastatic prostate cancer resulted in significantly longer overall survival than that with ADT alone.

Peripheral blood circulating tumor cell (CTC) count is the most extensively validated prognostic liquid biomarker in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), and recent studies have suggested that it may also be informative in mHSPC. OBJECTIVE: To examine the prognostic value of CTC count in men with mHSPC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this prognostic study, peripheral blood was drawn at registration (baseline) and at progression to mCRPC in the S1216 study (March 1, 2013, to July 15, 2017), a phase 3, prospective, randomized clinical trial in men with mHSPC. The CTCs were enumerated using a US Food and Drug Administration-cleared isolation platform. Counts were categorized as 0, 1 to 4, or 5 or more CTCs per 7.5 mL based on the prognostic value of these cut points in prior studies. The data analysis was performed between October 28, 2022, and June 15, 2023. EXPOSURE: Metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Circulating tumor cell count was evaluated for an association with 3 prespecified trial end points: OS, progression-free survival, and 7-month prostate-specific antigen, after adjusting for other baseline covariates using proportional hazards and logistic regression models. RESULTS: Of 1313 S1216 participants (median [IQR] age, 68 [44-92] years), evaluable samples from 503 (median [IQR] age, 69 [46-90] years) with newly diagnosed mHSPC were collected at baseline, and 93 samples were collected at progression. Baseline counts were 5 or more CTCs per 7.5 mL in 60 samples (11.9%), 1 to 4 CTCs per 7.5 mL in 107 samples (21.3%), and 0 CTCs per 7.5 mL in 336 samples (66.8%). Median OS for men with 5 or more CTCs per 7.5 mL was 27.9 months (95% CI, 24.1-31.2 months) compared with 56.2 months (95% CI, 45.7-69.8 months) for men with 1 to 4 CTCs per 7.5 mL and not reached at 78.0 months follow-up for men with 0 CTCs per 7.5 mL. After adjusting for baseline clinical covariates, men with 5 or more CTCs per 7.5 mL at baseline had a significantly higher hazard of death (hazard ratio, 3.22; 95% CI, 2.22-4.68) and disease progression (hazard ratio, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.76-3.43) and a lower likelihood of prostate-specific antigen complete response (odds ratio, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.12-0.54) compared with men with 0 CTCs per 7.5 mL at baseline. Adding baseline CTC count to other known prognostic factors (covariates only: area under the curve, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.67-0.79) resulted in an increased prognostic value for 3-year survival (area under the curve, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.73-0.84). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this prognostic study, the findings validate CTC count as a prognostic biomarker that improved upon existing prognostic factors and estimated vastly divergent survival outcomes regardless of subsequent lines of therapy. As such, baseline CTC count in mHSPC may serve as a valuable noninvasive biomarker to identify men likely to have poor survival who may benefit from clinical trials of intensified or novel regimens.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Unlike the endogenous decapeptide GnRH, leuprolide contains a single D-amino acid (D-leucyl) residue, which helps to increase its circulating half-life from three to four minutes to approximately three hours.[A203222] As a GnRH mimic, leuprolide is capable of binding to the GnRH receptor (GnRHR) and inducing downstream modulation of both gonadotropin hormone and sex steroid levels. Prolonged activation of GnRHR results in significant downregulation of sex steroid levels, which is primarily responsible for the clinical efficacy of leuprolide in diverse conditions, including advanced prostate cancer, endometriosis, and central precocious puberty.[A203126, A203132]\r\n\r\nLeuprolide was first approved in 1985 as a daily subcutaneous injection under the tradename Lupron\u2122 by Abbvie Endocrine Inc.[L13850] Since this initial approval, various long-acting intramuscular and subcutaneous products have been developed such that patients can be dosed once every six months.[L13781, L13790] Leuprolide remains frontline therapy in all conditions for which it is indicated for use.\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite.

Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nBicalutamide: Bicalutamide is an oral non-steroidal anti-androgen for prostate cancer.

Unlike the endogenous decapeptide GnRH, leuprolide contains a single D-amino acid (D-leucyl) residue, which helps to increase its circulating half-life from three to four minutes to approximately three hours.[A203222] As a GnRH mimic, leuprolide is capable of binding to the GnRH receptor (GnRHR) and inducing downstream modulation of both gonadotropin hormone and sex steroid levels. Prolonged activation of GnRHR results in significant downregulation of sex steroid levels, which is primarily responsible for the clinical efficacy of leuprolide in diverse conditions, including advanced prostate cancer, endometriosis, and central precocious puberty.[A203126, A203132]\r\n\r\nLeuprolide was first approved in 1985 as a daily subcutaneous injection under the tradename Lupron\u2122 by Abbvie Endocrine Inc.[L13850] Since this initial approval, various long-acting intramuscular and subcutaneous products have been developed such that patients can be dosed once every six months.[L13781, L13790] Leuprolide remains frontline therapy in all conditions for which it is indicated for use.\nBicalutamide: Bicalutamide is an oral non-steroidal anti-androgen for prostate cancer.

Here's my assessment:\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n*   **Stable Disease (Age 80.1 - 85):** The patient has demonstrated remarkably stable disease for approximately 5 years (from age 80.1 to 85). CT scans consistently show no evidence of progression.\n*   **PSA Levels:** PSA levels have remained generally low, fluctuating but never reaching concerningly high levels.\n*   **Treatment:** The patient was on Bicalutamide until age 84.8483 and Leuprolide with intermittent stops and starts.\n*   **Performance Status:** The patient's ECOG performance status declined from 0 to 3 over the period, indicating increasing frailty.\n*   **Recent Findings:** At age 84.062, bone and lung involvement were noted on CT scan, but this was not associated with progression.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n\nWhile the patient has remained remarkably stable for 5 years, several factors need consideration:\n\n*   **Age:** At 85, the patient is at increased risk of mortality from causes unrelated to cancer.\n*   **Declining Performance Status:** The worsening ECOG score suggests increasing frailty and vulnerability.\n*   **Prior Metastasis:** The history of lymph node metastasis indicates the potential for future recurrence.\n*   **Recent Findings:** The presence of bone and lung involvement, even without progression, is concerning.\n\nHowever, the prolonged stability is a very positive sign. Given the lack of progression on imaging for the past 5 years, I believe the risk of death from prostate cancer in the next 24 months is lower than previously estimated.\n\nConsidering the patient's age, the prolonged stability, and the declining performance status, I believe the most likely outcome is **A) Yes**, the patient will still be alive in the next 24 months. However, this is a nuanced assessment, and the patient's overall health and quality of life should be prioritized.\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"

There now exists a need to identify, effective agents for second line chemotherapy. 9-nitrocamptothecin (9-NC) a novel, oral camptothecin analogue was tested as second line chemotherapy for patients with progressive hormone refractory prostate cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had metastatic hormone refractory prostate cancer with performance status (0-1) following progression on at least 1 prior cytotoxic chemotherapy. 9-NC was administered orally at the dose of 1.5 mg/m2/d for 5 days each week for 3 weeks, followed by rest for 1 week. Response was evaluated after 2 cycles according to the guidelines set forth for Phase II trials in HRPC by the PSA working group. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were recruited to the study within a period of 6 months; 33 were evaluable for analysis. No patients had a >50% decline in PSA levels. Two out of 8 (25%) patients with measurable disease and 5/25 (20%) patients with nonmeasurable disease showed stable disease. The median time to disease and PSA progression was 2 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.9-2.8]. The median overall survival was 10 months (95% CI = 5-12). Seven patients are alive after a median follow-up of 23 months. CONCLUSIONS: 9-nitrocamptothecin failed to elicit clinical or PSA responses. Further study in pretreated HRPC patients is not warranted.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
