The relationship between the proportions of mucinous components to the oncological outcomes was examined to determine whether mucinous carcinoma should be classified as an independent histological type. METHODS: The study group comprised 1,038 patients with colon cancer. The relationships between the survival rates and recurrence patterns with the mucinous component area ratio (MC area ratio) and clinical variables were evaluated. RESULTS: Tumors were classified into three groups: Group 1 (MC area ratio, 0 %), Group 2 (1-49 %), and Group 3 (>/=50 %). Of the 1038 tumors studied, 877 (84 %) were classified as Group 1, 123 (12 %) as Group 2, and 38 (4 %) as Group 3. The tumor size was significantly larger in Group 3, and an increased MC area ratio was significantly related to a higher proportion of right-sided tumors. Among patients with stage II or III disease, stage III disease, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, and no adjuvant chemotherapy were poor prognostic factors. There was no relationship between the MC area ratio and the survival or recurrence pattern. CONCLUSION: Mucinous carcinoma does not need to be classified as a separate histological type from ordinary differentiated adenocarcinoma.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 35262818\nTitle: Recurrence of initially localized appendiceal mucinous neoplasms after radical resection: survey analysis and literature review.\nAuthors: Kitai T, Yonemura Y\nJournal: International journal of clinical oncology\nPublication Date: 2022 Jun\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (AMN) is a rare tumor that may be successfully treated by appendectomy. However, some patients develop recurrence as pseudomyxoma peritonei. The present study investigated the recurrence rate after radial resection for AMN. METHODS: A survey on AMN was sent to 171 institutions, and 286 cases were analyzed. The risk of recurrence was assessed according to clinical parameters. Recurrence rates were compared with data from the literature. RESULTS: There were 250 cases in the low-grade group and 36 in the high-grade group, with perforation being detected in 50 cases. After a median follow-up period of 30 months, recurrence was detected in 17 cases, including 12 with high-grade histology and 10 with perforation. Two patients with low-grade histology and no perforation developed recurrence. Independent prognostic factors for recurrence were high-grade histology (p = 0.0001, RR = 8.56) and perforation (p = 0.0168, RR = 3.45). Four groups were classified by histology and perforation: group A: high-grade, perforation ( +), group B: high-grade, perforation (-), group C: low-grade, perforation ( +), group D: low-grade, perforation (-). Five-year recurrence rates in groups A, B, C, and D were 46.7, 25.9, 13.3, and 1.5%, respectively. All cases of recurrence were detected within 3 years, except for two in group B. CONCLUSIONS: Recurrence in cases with low-grade histology and no perforation was rare; however, a postoperative survey for at least 3 years is required. In contrast, cases with high-grade histology or perforation need to be monitored using a similar approach to colon cancer. Prophylactic CRS + HIPEC may be considered.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 31729741\nTitle: Predictive factor of recurrence after curative resection for stage I-II colon cancer.\nAuthors: Dougaz W, Bouasker I, Gouta EL\nJournal: La Tunisie medicale\nPublication Date: 2019 May\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Colon cancer has become a common malignant neoplasm in Tunisia. Patients with negative lymph node have a 5 years recurrence rate of 21.1%. Studies reporting the prognostic factors of recurrence for patients with stage I-II colon cancer are limited. AIM: This study aimed to determine factors predicting recurrence for patients with stage I-II colon cancer after curative resection. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. Were included patients who underwent curative surgery for stage I or II colon cancer. Enrolled variables were subdivided into: Pre-operative, Intraoperative and Post-operative variables. Main outcome measures were local recurrence and distant metastasis detected during follow-up. RESULTS: Eighteen men and 17 women with median age of 61 years, ranging from 33 to 89, were enrolled in this study. Twenty-eight patients out of 35 were classified T3 and T4 colon cancer. The mean number of lymph nodes harvested was 16.23 (median= 17; range: 4-44). Ten patients (28%) had colloid component in the tumor. At a median follow-up of 23 months (range: 6-56 months), recurrence was observed in five cases (14%). Variables associated to recurrence were Carcinoembryonic antigen level (p= 0.03), serum albumin level (p=0.029) and the presence of colloid component (0.02). Multivariate logistic regression retained colloid component as the only predictive factor of recurrence (OR=1.2, 95%CI [1.019-1.412], p=0.028). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the percentage of mucinous component equal or greater than 25% was the only predictive factor of recurrence for curatively resected, stages I and II, colon cancer.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

The aim of this study was to determine the risk of recurrence following potentially curative surgery in OCC compared with that in uncomplicated colon cancer (CC). METHOD: Data were obtained from the population-based digestive cancer registry of Burgundy (France). Local and distant failure rates were calculated using actuarial methods. A multivariate analysis was performed using a Cox model. RESULTS: Obstructing colon cancer represented 8.5% of all colon cancers resected with curative intent (n = 3375). The 5-year cumulative local recurrence rate was 14.2% for OCC and 7.6% for nonobstructing CC (P = 0.003). In the multivariate analysis, obstruction was an independent risk factor for local recurrence [hazard ratio 1.53 (1.01-2.34), P = 0.047]. The risk of local recurrence increased with advanced stage and age at diagnosis. The 5-year cumulative rate for distant metastases was also higher in OCC than in nonobstructing CC (36.1 vs 23.1%; P < 0.001). The relative risk of distant metastasis was borderline significant in the multivariate analysis [hazard ratio 1.25 (0.99-1.59), P = 0.057]. Stage at diagnosis, macroscopic type of growth, period of diagnosis and sex were also significant prognostic factors. Age and subsite were not significant in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: It is possible to conduct special surveys in population-based registries to determine the recurrence rate of CC. Recurrence remains a substantial problem and is more frequent in OCC than in nonobstructing CC. Efforts must be made to diagnose CC earlier. Mass screening is a promising approach.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 29389929\nTitle: Disease recurrence following surgery for colorectal cancer: five-year follow-up.\nAuthors: Gunawardene A, Desmond B, Shekouh A\nJournal: The New Zealand medical journal\nPublication Date: 2018 Feb 2\nAbstract: AIM: To describe the patterns of recurrence in a contemporaneous cohort of patients undergoing surgery with curative intent for colorectal adenocarcinoma at a New Zealand hospital with five-year follow-up. METHODS: Patients with colorectal cancer undergoing potentially curative surgery between January 2010 and December 2012 were followed up for a median of 61 months with three-monthly CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen), a colonoscopy after one year and yearly computed tomography scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis for the first three years. RESULTS: Overall, 59/237 (24.9%) of patients experienced disease recurrence, the most common sites being the liver, followed by the lung and local recurrence. Recurrence rates did not differ significantly between colon and rectal cancer and ranged from 5.1% in stage I to 60% in stage IV. Seventy-three percent of all recurrences were observed within the first 24 months post-operatively. CONCLUSION: While New Zealand outcomes in colorectal cancer have historically compared unfavourably against international standards, the outcomes observed in this cohort are encouraging and may reflect advances in care, including multidisciplinary team discussion, increased use of adjuvant therapy, surgical subspecialisation and protocolled surveillance and follow-up.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 38136337\nTitle: Recurrence Patterns and Risk Factors after Curative Resection for Colorectal Cancer: Insights for Postoperative Surveillance Strategies.\nAuthors: Ryu HS, Kim J, Park YR\nJournal: Cancers\nPublication Date: 2023 Dec 10\nAbstract: This study aimed to assess recurrence patterns and related risk factors following curative resection of colorectal cancer (CRC). This retrospective observational study was conducted at a tertiary care center, including 2622 patients with stage I-III CRC who underwent curative resection between 2008 and 2018. Hazard rates of recurrence were calculated using a hazard function. The primary outcome was the peak recurrence time after curative resection and secondary outcomes were prognostic factors associated with recurrence. Over a median follow-up period of 53 months, the overall, locoregional and systemic recurrence rates were 8.9%, 0.7%, and 8.5%, respectively. Recurrence rates were significantly higher for rectal cancer (14.9% overall, 4.4% locoregionally, and 12.3% systemically) than for colon cancer (all p < 0.001). The peak recurrence time was 11 months, with variations in hazard rates and curves depending on the tumor location, stage, and risk factors. Patients with AL or CRM involvement exhibited a distinct pattern, with a high hazard rate in the early postoperative period. Understanding these recurrence patterns and risk factors is crucial for establishing effective postoperative surveillance strategies. Our findings suggested that short-interval surveillance should be considered during the first 2 years post-surgery, particularly for high-risk patients who should receive early attention.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Over time, some of these features acquired clinical dignity and were incorporated in decision making. Namely, microsatellite instability (MSI) due to mismatch repair of defects, which primarily was adopted for the diagnosis of Lynch syndrome, became recognized as the biomarker of a different disease type, showing a less aggressive behavior. MSI tumors harbor high amounts of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) due to their peculiar load in neoantigens. However, microsatellite stable colon cancer may also show high amounts of TILs, and this feature is as well associated with better outcomes. High TIL loads are in general associated with a favorable prognosis, especially in stage II colon cancer, and therein identifies a patient subset with the lowest probability of relapse. With respect to post-surgical adjuvant treatment, particularly in stage III, TILs predictive ability seems to weaken along with the progression of the disease, being less evident in high risk patients. Moving from cohort studies to the analysis of a series from clinical trials contributed to increase the robustness of TILs as a biomarker. The employment of high TIL densities as an indicator of good prognosis in early-stage colon cancers is strongly advisable, while in late-stage colon cancers the employment as an indicator of good responsiveness to post-surgical therapy requires refinement. It remains to be clarified whether TILs could help in identifying those patients with node-positive cancers to whom adjuvant treatment could be spared, at least in low-risk groups as defined by the TNM staging system.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 40023157\nTitle: IL-17RA signaling provides dual tumor-suppressor function during late-stage colorectal carcinogenesis.\nAuthors: Denk D, Ramakrishnan M, Conche C\nJournal: Immunity\nPublication Date: 2025 Mar 11\nAbstract: Expression of interleukin (IL)-17 family cytokines is associated with tumor-promoting inflammation. We found that low expression of IL17RA associated with worse prognosis in late-stage colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Deletion of Il17ra in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in a murine model of CRC enhanced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) via increased expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor and subsequent activation of the kinase Src. Yet, these mice were protected from metastatic disease; Il17ra deletion impaired intestinal barrier function and enhanced systemic fungal invasion and associated immunity. However, in macrophages, IL-17RA was required for spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) activation upon fungal-induced dectin-1 engagement, and Il17ra ablation impaired IL-18 release and protective CD8(+) T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. Combining recombinant IL-17 and heat-killed Candida albicans rendered colorectal tumors sensitive to alpha-PD-1 treatment in a model of microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC. Thus, IL-17RA engages two distinct tumor-suppressive mechanisms in CRC, linking EMT and fungal-induced anti-tumor immunity during tumor progression.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 36915460\nTitle: Using a combination of fruquintinib, raltitrexed, and S-1 as a third-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer with co-existence of Hodgkin lymphoma: a case report.\nAuthors: Wan Y, Luo D\nJournal: Journal of gastrointestinal oncology\nPublication Date: 2023 Feb 28\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) beyond second line treatment have a poor prognosis. Fruquintinib, regorafenib, trifluridine/tipiracil (TAS-102), panitumumab and cetuximab combined with single-agent chemotherapy regimens are currently recommended as third-line therapies for patients exhibiting disease progression. Effective late-line therapies for mCRC are urgently needed. The FRESCO randomized clinical trial (RCT) prompts fruquintinib as a third-line treatment in advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). A phase II study in our center reported the efficacy and safety of S-1 plus raltitrexed for the treatment of chemo-refractory mCRC. The combination of the fruquintinib, raltitrexed, and S-1 has not been reported in mCRC. CASE DESCRIPTION: This case report presents a patient with mCRC who received third-line treatment with fruquintinib, raltitrexed, and S-1. A 54-year-old male presenting with hematochezia was admitted to West China Hospital of Sichuan University in June 2017 and underwent surgery for a tumor between the rectum and sigmoid colon. Postoperative pathology identified adenocarcinoma (wild-type RAS/RAF, no PIK3CA mutation), and the patient was diagnosed with mCRC (pathological stage, pT3pN1apM0). The mFOLFOX6 regimen was administered. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma in May 2018 and treated with the ABVD regimen after multidisciplinary discussions. Liver metastases (intestinal-type adenocarcinoma) were detected in November 2018, and second-line therapy with the FOLFIRI regimen was initiated in January 2019. Lung metastases were identified in September 2019, so the patient was treated with a combination of raltitrexed, S-1, and fruquintinib. A partial response (PR) was detected in November 2019, and the patient underwent resection of the hepatic lesion on November 5, 2020. Computed tomography (CT) images in November 2021 revealed a stable disease; thus, raltitrexed was discontinued, and S-1 and fruquintinib were maintained. The treatment is still responding until the last follow-up (December 2022). CONCLUSIONS: The case was characterized by the simultaneous existence of mCRC and Hodgkin lymphoma, which required management by a multidisciplinary team. Third-line therapy with fruquintinib, raltitrexed, and S-1 achieved a PR that permitted surgical resection and enabled a relatively long progression-free survival. The findings suggest that the three agents regimen might be clinically effective as late-line therapy for mCRC.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Patients with T4a/4b disease had a similar response rate as those with T2-3 disease (84.0% vs 85.4%; P=.999). As of writing, a total of 50 patients have undergone surgery. Pathologic CR was achieved in most (57.1%) patients and remained high (59.5%) even among the 38 patients with T4a/4b disease. The 17 patients with CR did not undergo surgery and adopted a watch-and-wait strategy. After a median follow-up of 17.2 months (range, 3.4-45.1 months), the overall median recurrence-free and overall survivals were not reached. Among patients undergoing surgery or achieving CR, the 2-year tumor-specific disease-free and overall survival rates were both 100%. During neoadjuvant treatment, grade 3-4 adverse events occurred in 8 patients; 4 required acute intervention. Severe postoperative complications were recorded in 4 patients, 3 of whom required a second surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant therapy with PD-1 blockade is highly effective for localized dMMR CRC, with an acceptable safety profile and low recurrence rate. This treatment holds promise for becoming the new standard of care for localized dMMR CRCs.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 23222275\nTitle: Is curative resection and long-term survival possible for locally re-recurrent colorectal cancer in the pelvis?\nAuthors: Colibaseanu DT, Mathis KL, Abdelsattar ZM\nJournal: Diseases of the colon and rectum\nPublication Date: 2013 Jan\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: A multimodality approach for locally recurrent colorectal cancer in the pelvis provides a significant survival advantage when negative margins are achieved. However, outcomes of surgical resection in patients who have locally re-recurrent disease in the pelvis are not well studied. Our aim was to assess the safety, feasibility of a negative margin resection, and survival outcomes in patients with pelvic locally re-recurrent colorectal cancer. DESIGN: A retrospective review identified 406 patients who underwent surgery for locally recurrent colorectal cancer between 1997 and 2007. Patients who had locally re-recurrent disease in the pelvis who underwent curative-intent resection were identified. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients (31 male) were identified. Median age was 57 years (range, 30-84 years). Median time to re-recurrence was 2.4 years (range, 0.5-5.6 years). Margin status following re-resection was R0 60%, R1 32%, and R2 8%. Nonbowel organs were resected en bloc in 81%, including 7 sacral resections. Intraoperative radiation was given to 77%. Morbidity occurred in 42%, with 6% requiring reoperation for complications. Thirty-day mortality was nil. Overall survival at 2 and 5 years was 83% and 33%. Disease-free survival at 2 and 5 years was 55% and 27%. Five-year survival for patients who had R0 and R1 resections was 37% and 42%, whereas no patients having an R2 resection survived beyond 2 years (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: In highly selected patients with re-recurrent colorectal cancer in the pelvis, we found that surgery could be performed safely and that a curative (R0) resection was possible in more than 50%. Two- and 5-year survival rates are comparable to results seen when surgery is done for first-time recurrences.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 30722115\nTitle: Is advanced age a hesitation for cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy in colorectal cancer?\nAuthors: Cigdem Arslan N, Bisgin T, Altay C\nJournal: Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology\nPublication Date: 2018 Dec\nAbstract: PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility and safety of cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) in elderly patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis of colorectal cancer. METHODS: Patients who underwent curative complete CRS and HIPEC for peritoneal carcinomatosis of colorectal cancer with minimum follow-up of 24 months were included in the analysis. Charlson comorbidity index and ECOG performance status were used to evaluate preoperative condition. Patients were tiered into two groups according to age (<65 and >/=65 years). Postoperative morbidity, mortality, recurrence, and overall survival were compared between groups. RESULTS: One-hundred patients were meeting the inclusion criteria. Median age was 56 years (ranging, 20-86). The origin of peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) was colon in 77 and rectum in 23 patients. There were 31 patients in the elderly group. Mean hospital stay was 17\uf0b111.8 and 16.8\uf0b114.3 days in young and elderly groups (p=0.937). In young patients, postoperative morbidity was seen in 26 (37.6%) patients versus 9 (29%) patients in elderly group (p=0.272). Mortality was higher in elderly group (n=4, 12.9%) than in the younger group (n=5, 7.2%), but the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.287). Median follow-up was 25 months (ranging, 2-112). Local and/or distant recurrence occurred in 30 (43.4%) patients in the young group and 9 (29%) patients in elderly group (p=0.169). Two-years disease-free survival was similar: 67.1% in the young and 74% in the elderly groups (p=0.713). CONCLUSIONS: CRS and HIPEC offer comparable oncologic outcome in meticulously selected medically-fit elderly patients without increased postoperative morbidity and mortality.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

chemotherapeutic agent. It was originally investigated for its antiviral effects, but it is now used as an anticancer therapy for various cancers.[A233135] Gemcitabine is a cytidine analog with two fluorine atoms replacing the hydroxyl on the ribose.[A233145] As a prodrug, gemcitabine is transformed into its active metabolites that work by replacing the building blocks of nucleic acids during DNA elongation, arresting tumour growth and promoting apoptosis of malignant cells.[L32960] The structure, metabolism, and mechanism of action of gemcitabine are similar to [cytarabine], but gemcitabine has a wider spectrum of antitumour activity.[A233140]\r\n\r\nGemcitabine is marketed as Gemzar and it is available as intravenous injection. It is approved by the FDA to treat advanced ovarian cancer in combination with [carboplatin], metastatic breast cancer in combination with [paclitaxel], non-small cell lung cancer in combination with [cisplatin], and pancreatic cancer as monotherapy.[L32950] It is also being investigated in other cancer and tumour types.\nOxaliplatin: Oxaliplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis.

In these cases the 1 year survival rate ranged from 20 % to 50 % depending of performance status and the used regimen. Thus, symptomatic supportive treatment is as important as palliative chemotherapy. Today several evidence-based chemotherapies are available - and others are expected soon - resulting in a highly significant overall survival benefit. Individual patient characteristics have to be considered for the selection of treatment. Even after successful surgery with curative intention, the 5-year survival rate is about 10 %. By adjuvant chemotherapy the survival probability as well as cure rate can be more than doubled. Since the preparation of the S3 guidelines for pancreatic cancer additional options in the care of patients with pancreatic cancer have become available to be incorporated in clinical practice.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 39614657\nTitle: Survival scenarios of patients with localized and metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma: A population-based study.\nAuthors: Kuijper SC, Gehrels AM, van der Geest LG\nJournal: International journal of cancer\nPublication Date: 2025 May 1\nAbstract: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC) is notorious for its poor survival. The provision of survival scenarios-that is, best-case, typical and worst-case scenarios-could prove valuable to patients and clinicians. This study investigated survival scenarios and how these have changed over a period of 16 years for patients with PAC. Data from the Netherlands Cancer Registry were used to identify patients with localized and metastatic PAC (2005-2021). Survival scenarios, including best-case, upper-typical, typical (median), lower-typical, and worst-case, were estimated based on survival curve percentiles (p10, p25, p50, p75, and p90). Annual differences were assessed for significance using weighted linear regression analyses. Factors associated with these scenarios were identified through univariable tests. Overall, 14,622 patients with localized and 20,199 with metastatic PAC were included. For patients with localized PAC, the best, upper-typical and typical survival scenarios improved statistically significant with average annual improvement of 1.54 (95%CI: 1.2-1.88), 0.67 (0.56-0.78), and 0.24 (0.19-0.29) months, respectively. For patients with metastatic PAC the best and upper-typical survival scenarios increased statically significantly with annual improvement of 0.28 (0.21-0.34) and 0.06 (0.02-0.09) months, respectively. The best-case and upper-typical scenarios were associated with younger patients, more aggressive disease-focused treatments, fewer comorbidities, and better overall performance status. Over the past 16 years, survival improvements in patients with PAC have been most notable in these scenarios. Although the absolute gains were modest, these results offer encouraging potential for advancements in life-prolonging care for this type of cancer.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 11096341\nTitle: Prognostic factors in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma receiving systemic chemotherapy.\nAuthors: Ueno H, Okada S, Okusaka T\nJournal: Oncology\nPublication Date: 2000 Nov\nAbstract: The aim of the present study was to determine prognostic factors in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PC) receiving systemic chemotherapy. The relationship between patient characteristics and prognosis was examined in 103 consecutive patients with metastatic PC. The overall median survival time and 1-year survival rate were 3.2 months and 5.6%, respectively. Among the 20 potential prognostic variables investigated, only three variables, a serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level of > or =5 mg/dl, the performance status of 2-3 and a serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) level of > or =10,000 U/ml were identified as the factors independently associated with a shorter survival. A prognostic index based on the regression coefficients of these three factors was proposed to classify the patients into three groups, with good, intermediate and poor prognosis. The median survival time for these three groups was 5.2, 2.6 and 1.4 months, respectively. The findings of this study may be useful in determining treatment strategies and in designing future clinical trials of systemic chemotherapy for metastatic PC.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
