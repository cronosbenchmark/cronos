Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

Early tumor recurrence before or during adjuvant chemotherapy has not been evaluated so far. These patients may not benefit from adjuvant treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-five patients with resection of ductal pancreatic carcinoma and adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine were analyzed between 2005 and 2007. All patients had a computed tomography (CT) scan before and during adjuvant chemotherapy after 2-3 months, 12/35 patients had a histologically confirmed R1 resection. Recurrence of pancreatic cancer was determined by CT scan and the clinical course. RESULTS: Median survival of 35 patients with resected pancreatic cancer was 19.7 months, and the 2-year survival was 44%. Thirteen (37%) of the 35 patients analyzed with a CT scan showed tumor recurrence during adjuvant chemotherapy. Overall survival of patients with tumor recurrence was 9.3 months with a 2-year survival rate of 13%, whereas median overall survival of patients without early relapse was 26.3 months (P<0.001). Local recurrence of pancreatic cancer occurred in 38% (5/13); 46% (6/13) of patients developed distant metastasis, and 38% (5/13) developed lymph node metastasis. Early tumor recurrence during or adjuvant chemotherapy did not correlate with R status (R1 vs R0, P=0.69), whereas histologically confirmed lymph node invasion (pN0 vs pN1) and grading showed a statistically significant correlation with early relapse (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: A significant fraction of patients with resected pancreatic cancer have early relapse during adjuvant chemotherapy, especially those with lymph node metastasis. Radiologic examinations prior to and during adjuvant chemotherapy will help to identify patients with tumor recurrence who are unlikely to benefit from adjuvant treatment and will need individualized palliative chemotherapy.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 31483448\nTitle: Patterns of Recurrence After Resection of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma: A Secondary Analysis of the ESPAC-4 Randomized Adjuvant Chemotherapy Trial.\nAuthors: Jones RP, Psarelli EE, Jackson R\nJournal: JAMA surgery\nPublication Date: 2019 Nov 1\nAbstract: IMPORTANCE: The patterns of disease recurrence after resection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with adjuvant chemotherapy remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: To define patterns of recurrence after adjuvant chemotherapy and the association with survival. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospectively collected data from the phase 3 European Study Group for Pancreatic Cancer 4 adjuvant clinical trial, an international multicenter study. The study included 730 patients who had resection and adjuvant chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer. Data were analyzed between July 2017 and May 2019. INTERVENTIONS: Randomization to adjuvant gemcitabine or gemcitabine plus capecitabine. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Overall survival, recurrence, and sites of recurrence. RESULTS: Of the 730 patients, median age was 65 years (range 37-81 years), 414 were men (57%), and 316 were women (43%). The median follow-up time from randomization was 43.2 months (95% CI, 39.7-45.5 months), with overall survival from time of surgery of 27.9 months (95% CI, 24.8-29.9 months) with gemcitabine and 30.2 months (95% CI, 25.8-33.5 months) with the combination (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.68-0.98; P = .03). The 5-year survival estimates were 17.1% (95% CI, 11.6%-23.5%) and 28.0% (22.0%-34.3%), respectively. Recurrence occurred in 479 patients (65.6%); another 78 patients (10.7%) died without recurrence. Local recurrence occurred at a median of 11.63 months (95% CI, 10.05-12.19 months), significantly different from those with distant recurrence with a median of 9.49 months (95% CI, 8.44-10.71 months) (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.01-1.45; P = .04). Following recurrence, the median survival was 9.36 months (95% CI, 8.08-10.48 months) for local recurrence and 8.94 months (95% CI, 7.82-11.17 months) with distant recurrence (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.73-1.09; P = .27). The median overall survival of patients with distant-only recurrence (23.03 months; 95% CI, 19.55-25.85 months) or local with distant recurrence (23.82 months; 95% CI, 17.48-28.32 months) was not significantly different from those with only local recurrence (24.83 months; 95% CI, 22.96-27.63 months) (P = .85 and P = .35, respectively). Gemcitabine plus capecitabine had a 21% reduction of death following recurrence compared with monotherapy (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.64-0.98; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: There were no significant differences between the time to recurrence and subsequent and overall survival between local and distant recurrence. Pancreatic cancer behaves as a systemic disease requiring effective systemic therapy after resection.

The role of adjuvant chemoradiation therapy (ACRT) remains controversial. What is less clear is whether adjuvant therapy influences patterns of recurrence. The purpose of this study was to perform the first multicenter study analyzing patterns of recurrence after adjuvant therapy for PDAC. STUDY DESIGN: Patients undergoing resection for PDAC from 8 medical centers over a 10-year period were analyzed. Demographics, tumor characteristics, operative treatment, type of adjuvant therapy, recurrence pattern, and survival were reviewed. Using Cox-proportional hazards multivariate (MV) regression, the impact of ACT and ACRT on overall survival (OS), local recurrence (LR), and distant recurrence (DR) was investigated. RESULTS: There were 1,130 patients who were divided into those having surgery alone (n = 392), ACT (n = 291), or ACRT (n = 447). Median follow-up was 18 months. Compared with patients undergoing surgery alone, ACT, but not ACRT, demonstrated a significant OS advantage on MV analysis. Patients receiving ACT had significantly fewer recurrences (LR and DR); those receiving ACRT had significantly less LR but not DR. On subset MV analysis, ACT and ACRT resulted in less LR in patients with lymph node (LN) positive and margin negative disease. No improvements in LR, DR, or OS were seen in margin positive patients with either ACT or ACRT. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first analysis demonstrating differences in recurrence patterns in PDAC patients based on type of adjuvant therapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy provided an OS advantage likely related to its effect on reducing both LR and DR. Adjuvant chemoradiation therapy appears to decrease LR, but not DR, and therefore has less impact on OS. Future investigations and treatment protocols should consider additional ACT rather than ACRT in the treatment of PDAC.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Here's a breakdown of how the articles inform the risk of recurrence:\n\n*   **Article #1 (Fischer et al., 2012):** Highlights that *early* recurrence during adjuvant chemotherapy is a negative prognostic factor, with significantly reduced survival. However, this study focuses on patients *during* treatment, and the patient in question has completed treatment with no evidence of progression on recent scans.\n*   **Article #2 (Jones et al., 2019):** This large study (ESPAC-4 trial) shows that recurrence is common (65.6%), but importantly, there wasn't a significant difference in survival based on *site* of recurrence (local vs. distant).

This implies that even with recurrence, treatment can still be effective.\n*   **Article #3 (Parikh et al., 2016):** Demonstrates that adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) reduces both local and distant recurrence, while chemoradiation (ACRT) primarily reduces local recurrence.

Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I.

This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: timeline1.txt] included in your context\nAGE: 51.790, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: Yes, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 51.790, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has progressed.\nAGE: 51.790, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), CT, TUMOR_SITE: Other, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 51.790, labtest > ca_19-9_labs --> RESULT: 14, LR_UNIT_MEASURE: Units/ml, \nAGE: 51.790, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 2.0000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 51.840, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: PET, HAS_CANCER: Yes, PROCEDURE_TYPE: PET, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: Yes, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 51.840, diagnosis > progression --> PROGRESSION: Indeterminate, PROCEDURE_TYPE: PET, \nAGE: 51.840, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), PET, TUMOR_SITE: Other, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, HEAD: Yes, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 51.850, treatment > treatment --> STOP_AGE: 51.8778, SUBTYPE: Chemo, AGENT: CAPECITABINE, RX_INVESTIGATIVE: N, FLAG_OROTOPICAL: 1, \nAGE: 51.850, labtest > ca_19-9_labs --> RESULT: 13, LR_UNIT_MEASURE: Units/ml, \nAGE: 51.927, treatment > radiation --> SUBTYPE: Radiation Therapy, \nAGE: 52.097, labtest > ca_19-9_labs --> RESULT: 16, LR_UNIT_MEASURE: Units/ml, \nAGE: 52.138, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: Yes, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 52.138, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 52.138, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), CT, TUMOR_SITE: Other, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 52.138, labtest > ca_19-9_labs --> RESULT: 30, LR_UNIT_MEASURE: Units/ml, \nAGE: 52.138, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 3.5000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 52.385, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: Yes, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 52.385, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 52.385, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), CT, TUMOR_SITE: Other, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 52.385, labtest > ca_19-9_labs --> RESULT: 2305, LR_UNIT_MEASURE: Units/ml, \nAGE: 52.385, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 3.3000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 52.390, diagnosis > performance_status --> ECOG: 1, \n\n[DrugBank: Capecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers.

However, this recommendation is based on data from anatomically resectable and borderline resectable PDAC patients. Therefore, we analyzed the association of preoperative CA 19-9 with oncologic outcomes in a cohort of anatomically resectable PDAC patients. METHODS: A single-institution PDAC database from 2007 to 2015 included patients who underwent guideline-based staging and were anatomically resectable. Patients with bilirubin above 1.5 after decompression, nonsecretors of CA 19-9, and borderline resectable patients were excluded. Statistical analysis included frequency testing and regression modeling for recurrence and survival. RESULTS: One hundred forty-four PDAC patients were identified; 16 (11.1%) had elevated preoperative CA 19-9 >/= 1000. A CA 19-9 level >/=1000 was not associated with demographic, clinical, or pathological factors. After adjustment for potential confounders, CA 19-9 levels (continuous, median, 500 U/mL, or 1000 U/mL cut-offs) were not associated with recurrence or overall survival (OS). CONCLUSIONS: Although guidelines recommend CA 19-9 to determine the management of anatomically resectable PDAC patients, CA 19-9 was not associated with recurrence or OS in this cohort. Our findings do not suggest that CA 19-9 alone should determine the PDAC treatment strategy.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 38944571\nTitle: Differential impact of incrementally elevated CA 19-9 levels on prognosis of resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Bhandare MS, Gupta V, Chaudhari V\nJournal: HPB : the official journal of the International Hepato Pancreato Biliary Association\nPublication Date: 2024 Oct\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: CA 19-9 is an extremely useful biomarker for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs). However, the optimal cut-off and prognostic significance at higher cut-offs are yet to be determined. METHODS: Retrospective analysis included patients with PDAC who underwent curative resection from January 2010 to May 2020 at Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai. The pretherapy CA 19-9 was dichotomized using various cut-off levels and analysed. RESULTS: In 244 included patients, the median overall survival (OS) for those with CA19-9 level (IU/ml) < or >78, 200, 500, 1000, and 2000 was 27, 24, 23, 22, 21 months versus 18, 16, 15, 14, 13 months; respectively, and was statistically significant (p-value- 0.002, 0.001, 0.002, 0.002 and 0.004, respectively). The number of recurrences and mortality had significant correlation with CA 19-9 cut-offs. On multivariate analysis, adjuvant treatment completion (p-0.004) and decreasing or stable CA19-9 after Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) (p- 0.031) were associated with improved OS. CONCLUSION: The prognostic significance of CA 19-9 was observed at all the cut-off levels examined, beyond mere elevated value as per the standard cut-off level. In patients with high CA19-9 level, surgery should be offered if technically and conditionally feasible, only when a response in CA19-9 level to NAT is achieved.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 28219450\nTitle: Evaluation of serum D-dimer, fibrinogen, and CA19-9 for postoperative monitoring and survival prediction in resectable pancreatic carcinoma.\nAuthors: Cao J, Fu Z, Gao L\nJournal: World journal of surgical oncology\nPublication Date: 2017 Feb 20\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: We sought to investigate the efficacy of serum D-dimer, fibrinogen, and CA19-9 for postoperative monitoring and prediction of survival in patients with resectable pancreatic carcinoma (PC). METHODS: One hundred and nineteen patients with resectable PC were enrolled. Serum D-dimer, fibrinogen, and CA19-9 values were analyzed before surgery and at the stages of relapse-free and progression disease. RESULTS: D-dimer, fibrinogen, and CA19-9 were significantly higher at the active stage of PC than those at the relapse-free stage [1059.2 (1690.1) ng/ml vs 485.18 (289.84) ng/ml, (3.71 +/- 0.83) g/l vs (2.75 +/- 0.52) g/l, 207.2 (681.8) U/ml vs 24.5 (30) U/ml, respectively, p < 0.01]. Patients with elevated preoperative D-dimer had significantly shorter overall survival (18.9 +/- 1.9 months vs 29.2 +/- 2.6 months, p < 0.01) and progression-free survival (10.6 +/- 1.2 months vs 20.4 +/- 2.4 months, p < 0.01) than did those with low D-dimer. The correlation between CA19-9 values and survival depended on the threshold value of CA19-9: when the threshold value was 37 U/ml, there was no correlation between CA19-9 and survival; when the threshold value was 253.8 U/ml (median CA19-9 for the enrolled patients), patients with elevated preoperative CA19-9 had significantly shorter overall survival (19.9 +/- 2. 1 months vs 29.0 +/- 2. 7 months) and progression-free survival (11.5 +/- 1.5 months vs 21.0 +/- 2. 6 months) than did the patients with low CA19-9 (p < 0.01); when the threshold value was 1000 U/ml, the overall survival was 15.5 +/- 2.3 months vs 28.0 +/- 2.0 months and the progression-free survival 8.9 +/- 1.9 months vs 19.1 +/- 1.9 months (p < 0.01). There was no correlation between fibrinogen and overall survival (25.8 +/- 2.1 months vs 21.2 +/- 2.9 months; p = 0.096) and progression-free survival (17.8 +/- 2.1 months vs 12.7 +/- 1.7 months; p = 0.168). CONCLUSIONS: For postoperative monitoring of patients with resectable PC, D-dimer, fibrinogen, and CA19-9 may be used as markers for monitoring disease relapse, but only preoperative D-dimer could predict survival.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
