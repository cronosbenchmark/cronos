Even early-stage patients might encounter disease recurrence with relative high risk. Effective postoperative therapy is based on an accurate assessment of treatment failure after surgery. The aim of this study is to construct a disease-free survival (DFS) prediction model and stratify patients into different risk score groups.A total of 356 pathological stage I patients (7th American Joint Committee on Cancer) who underwent lung resection from January 2005 through June 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. Of these patients, 63 patients were eliminated for this study. A total of 293 p-stage I patients were included for further univariate and multivariate analysis. Clinical, surgical, and pathological factors associated with high risk of recurrence were analyzed, including age, gender, smoking status, additional primary malignancy (APM), operation method, histology, visceral pleural invasion, angiolymphatic invasion, tumor necrosis, and tumor size.Of the 293 p-stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients examined, 143 were female and 150 were male, with a mean age of 62.8-years old (range: 25-83-years old). The 5-year DFS and overall survival rates after surgery were 58.9% and 75.3%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, current smoker (hazards ratio [HR]: 1.63), APM (HR: 1.86), tumor size (HR: 1.54, 2.03), nonanatomic resections (HR: 1.81), adenocarcinoma histology (HR: 2.07), visceral pleural invasion (HR: 1.54), and angiolymphatic invasion (HR: 1.53) were found to be associated with a higher risk of tumor recurrence. The final model showed a fair discrimination ability (C-statistic = 0.68). According to the difference risk group, we found patients with intermediate or higher risk group had a higher distal relapse tendency as compared with low risk group (P = 0.016, odds ratio: 3.31, 95% confidence interval: 1.21-9.03).Greater than 30% of disease recurrences occurred after surgery for stage I NSCLC patients. That is why we try to establish an effective DFS predicting model based on clinical, pathological, and surgical covariates. However, our initial results still need to be validated and refined into greater population for better application in clinical use.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 26214632\nTitle: Risk factors for recurrence in patients with resected N1 non-small cell lung cancer - a systematic review and meta-analysis.\nAuthors: Luo H, Qiao L, Liang N\nJournal: Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology\nPublication Date: 2015 May-Jun\nAbstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate the rates of locoregional failure (LRF) vs distant metastasis (DM), and find risk factors for recurrence in patients with completely resected N1 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: By searching Pubmed, Embase and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register from 1995 through 2014, eligible randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were identified. In addition, the reference lists of articles and conference abstracts were searched. The logarithm of the risk ratio (RR) and its standard error (SE) were calculated, and a fixed-effect model was used to combine the estimates. RESULTS: 3 RCTs and 9 retrospective studies, which included 889 patients, were identified and selected. All studies dealt with resected N1 NSCLC, LRF vs DM, and risk factors such as visceral pleural invasion (VPI) and lymphovascular invasion (LVI). There was statistically significant benefit on 5-year overall survival (OS) for LRF (RR=0.68,95% CI=0.60-0.78, p<0.00001). Further analysis for patients with LRF also showed that VPI (RR=1.25, 95% confidence interval/CI=1.09-1.42, p=0.0009), LVI (RR=1.16, 95% CI=1.04-1.30, p=0.009), were the main risk factors for recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicates that in patients with resected N1 NSCLC, the incidence of LRF is lower than DM. Advanced T stage classification, VPI, and LVI were predictors of poor survival. These patients represent a subgroup with N1 disease who might benefit from additional therapy, including adjuvant radiotherapy (RT). However, large, well-designed prospective studies should be conducted to confirm this conclusion.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 23681341\nTitle: Risk factors for recurrence after lung cancer resection as estimated using the survival tree method.\nAuthors: Sawada S, Yamashita N, Suehisa H\nJournal: Chest\nPublication Date: 2013 Oct\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Patients with lung cancer often present with recurrence, even after resection. The identification of risk factors for recurrence after resection is useful. METHODS: Among 1,338 patients with lung cancer who underwent a complete resection, 277 developed recurrences post surgery. Data regarding the TNM factors, histologic subtype, and presence/absence of vessel invasion were analyzed retrospectively using the survival tree method to identify groups with a high risk of recurrence after resection. RESULTS: The results revealed that the T factor, the N factor, and lymphatic (ly) and blood (v) vessel invasion were related to the risk of recurrence, and six combinations of these factors were identified using the survival tree method: group A: v = 0, T </= 1b, ly = 0; group B: v = 0, T </= 1b, ly >/= 1; group C: v = 0, T >/= 2a; group D: v >/= 1, N </= 1, T </= 2b; group E: v >/= 1, N </= 1, T >/= 3; and group F: v >/= 1, N >/= 2. The six groups were then further classified into three groups: a low-risk group (group A), a moderate-risk group (groups B, C, and D), and a high-risk group (groups E and F). The 5-year recurrence-free survival rate was approximately 98% for the low-risk group, 75% for the moderate-risk group, and 30% for the high-risk group. CONCLUSIONS: Combining the T, N, v, and ly factors allowed the precise identification of a group with a high risk of recurrence after resection.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

It was generated by grafting the variable sequences of a very high-affinity mouse antihuman PD-1 antibody onto a human IgG4-kappa isotype containing a stabilizing S228P Fc mutation.[A18829] It contains 32 cysteine residues and the complete folded molecule includes 4 disulfide linkages as interchain bonds and 23 interchain bonds.[F136] It was developed by Merck & Co and first approved for the treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma by the FDA on September 4, 2014,[L2954] becoming the first approved therapy against PD-1.[A7624] In the time since its initial approval, pembrolizumab has been granted approval in the treatment of a wide variety of cancers.[L38934,L43257]\nLenvatinib: Lenvatinib is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor that inhibits the kinase activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4). Lenvatinib also inhibits other RTKs that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4; the platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR\u03b1), KIT, and RET. These receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) located in the cell membrane play a central role in the activation of signal transduction pathways involved in the normal regulation of cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis and differentiation, and in pathogenic angiogenesis, lymphogenesis, tumour growth and cancer progression. In particular, VEGF has been identified as a crucial regulator of both physiologic and pathologic angiogenesis and increased expression of VEGF is associated with a poor prognosis in many types of cancers.\r\n\r\nLenvatinib is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioactive iodine (RAI)-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. Most patients with thyroid cancer have a very good prognosis with treatment (98% 5 year survival rate) involving surgery and hormone therapy. However, for patients with RAI-refractory thyroid cancer, treatment options are limited and the prognosis is poor, leading to a push for the development of more targeted therapies such as lenvatinib.\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0041506-T01-IM6\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0041506\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Lung\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Lung Adenocarcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT468\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 785, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 30.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"LUAD\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

In the context of salvage therapy, symptom palliation and quality-of-life improvements, besides survival prolongation, are primary treatment endpoints. A variety of single-agent and multi-agent chemotherapy regimens have been tested with limited success in patients with recurrent SCLC. A number of combination regimens have demonstrated high response rates in second-line settings, but these can be considered only for patients with good performance status. Treatment outcome depends on many factors, including type of response to first-line therapy, treatment-free interval, and performance status. Currently, topotecan represents an effective, tolerable therapeutic option and is the only agent approved for this indication. The management of patients with recurrent disease remains an area of active research. This review provides an update of clinical research on second-line chemotherapy of SCLC and of recent results obtained with novel molecular targeted approaches in both first- and second-line therapy.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 26878692\nTitle: Optimal drugs for second-line treatment of patients with small-cell lung cancer.\nAuthors: Rossi A, Sacco PC, Sgambato A\nJournal: Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy\nPublication Date: 2016\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION: Despite the high response rate to chemotherapy, there have been few advances in the treatment of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) in the last decades. The state-of-the-art second-line therapy and future research developments in relapsed SCLC are reviewed. AREAS COVERED: There are no optimal drugs for second-line treatment of recurrent SCLC but only agents registered for this use. Topotecan remains the standard-of-care for the treatment of second-line platinum-sensitive SCLC patients worldwide, while amrubicin is another option, but registered only in Japan. To date, no targeted agents reporting interesting results in second-line SCLC treatment are available. The next-generation DNA sequencing should discover somatic gene alterations and their roles in SCLC to help in selecting patients who could benefit from a targeted agent. Two immunotherapeutics, ipilimumab and nivolumab, have shown promising preliminary results and are being investigated in ongoing trials. EXPERT OPINION: Second-line treatment is not an option for most SCLC patients. Given the evidence up to now, the potentials for immuno-oncology in SCLC are high. The hope is that these expectations are met, and that all drugs being developed will offer new and improved treatment options for SCLC patients.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 10561261\nTitle: Gemcitabine as second-line treatment for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: A phase II trial.\nAuthors: Crino L, Mosconi AM, Scagliotti G\nJournal: Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology\nPublication Date: 1999 Jul\nAbstract: PURPOSE: To investigate the activity and toxicity of gemcitabine as a single agent in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after recurrence or failure of previous treatment with a platinum-containing regimen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From November 1995 to October 1997, 83 patients with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC received gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) once a week for 3 weeks every 28 days. Responses were assessed every two treatment courses. The median age of the patients was 63 years; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 0 to 1 in 62 patients and 2 in 21 patients. The predominant histology was squamous (39 patients); 49 patients had stage IV disease and 34 patients had stage III disease (33 stage IIIB and one stage IIIA). RESULTS: Sixteen patients (19%) achieved a partial response to treatment; the median duration of response was 29 weeks (range, 6 to 50 weeks). Treatment was well tolerated: grade 2 to 3 (World Health Organization standardized response criteria) leukopenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 23% and 20% of patients, respectively. Mild asthenia was observed in 16% of patients, and peripheral edema in 5% of patients. Nausea and vomiting were present in 16% of patients. CONCLUSION: In this experience, gemcitabine showed significant activity without relevant toxicity, mainly in patients who were previously responsive to chemotherapy. This suggests a possible role for gemcitabine as a second-line treatment in patients who had a previous response or achieved stable disease with a platinum-containing regimen.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

METHODS: Using data obtained from eight Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries from 2004 through 2019, we addressed the long-term trends in the incidence, incidence-based mortality (IBM), and survival of lung cancer patients in the United States. RESULTS: The incidence and IBM of both non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) all significantly decreased steadily from 2004 to 2019. The 1-year survival (1-YS) of both NSCLC and SCLC improved over time, with the best improvement observed for Stage 4 NSCLC. Two significant turning points of Stage 4 NSCLC 1-YS were observed over the years: 0.63% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.33%-0.93%) from 2004 to 2010, 0.81% (95% CI: 0.41%-1.21%) from 2010 to 2014 and a striking 2.09% (95% CI: 1.70%-2.47%) from 2014 to 2019. The same two turning points in 1-YS were pronounced for Stage 4 NSCLC in women, which were coincident with the introduction of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) and immunotherapy. However, for Stage 4 NSCLC in men, only one significant turning point in the 1-YS starting in 2014 was found, which might only correspond to immunotherapy. Significant period effects in reduced IBM were also observed for both Stage 4 AD and Stage 4 SQCC during the period. CONCLUSION: This SEER analysis found that immunotherapy improved the survival of Stage 4 NSCLC patients at the population level in the United States.

METHODS: A retrospective observational design was applied to cases from the Hospital Cancer Registry of Euskadi. A cohort of 11,635 patients had complete data for the following variables: TNM stage, age, sex, histology, date of diagnosis, vital status and date of death. Relative survival and Cox and parametric regression models were used to assess changes in survival. RESULTS: The lung cancer 5-year survival probability decreased with increasing stage, from 50-65% in patients with stage I disease to 2-3% in those with stage IV disease. Comparing patients diagnosed from 2011-2014 and 2003-2006, we found that survival improved: (a) the risk of death (hazard ratio) in 2003-2006 was 1.66 for stage I, 1.51 for stage II, 1.21 for stage III, and 1.10 for stage IV; (b) the 5-year relative survival increased from 11.0% to 17.8% in the period 2011-2014; and (c) the years of life lost decreased significantly from 2003-2006 to 2011-2014, varying between 6.16 (stage I) and 16.21 (stage IV). CONCLUSIONS: Survival from lung cancer by stage in the Basque Country has lengthened significantly across all disease stages. Nonetheless, since we estimated that lung cancer patients still have significantly lower mean survival times than the general population, there is a need for more research to improve these outcomes.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 27793413\nTitle: Lung cancer: Incidence and survival in Rabat, Morocco.\nAuthors: Lachgar A, Tazi MA, Afif M\nJournal: Revue d'epidemiologie et de sante publique\nPublication Date: 2016 Dec\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide, but epidemiologic data from developing countries are lacking. This article reports lung cancer incidence and survival in Rabat, the capital of Morocco. METHODS: All lung cancer cases diagnosed between 2005 and 2008 were analyzed using data provided by the Rabat Cancer Registry. The standardized rate was reported using age adjustment with respect to the world standard population, and the observed survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Three hundred fifty-one cases were registered (314 males and 37 females), aged 27-90 years (median, 59 years). The most common pathological type was adenocarcinoma (40.2%) followed by squamous cell carcinoma (31.9%); the majority of cases were diagnosed at stage IV (52%). The age-standardized incidence rate was 25.1 and 2.7 per 100,000 for males and females, respectively, and the overall observed survival rates at 1 and 5 years were 31.7% and 3.4%, respectively. The clinical stage of disease was the only independent predictor of survival. CONCLUSION: The survival rate of lung cancer in Rabat is very poor. This finding explains the need for measures to reduce the prevalence of tobacco and to improve diagnostic and therapeutic facilities for lung cancer.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

(2024):** Shows improved 1-year survival for Stage 4 NSCLC in the US, particularly from 2014-2019, coinciding with the introduction of EGFR-TKIs and immunotherapy. 1-year survival reached 2.09%.\n*   **Mar et al. (2020):** Reports 5-year survival of 2-3% for Stage IV lung cancer, with improvements observed between 2003-2014.\n*   **Lachgar et al. (2016):** Reports 1-year survival of 31.7% and 5-year survival of only 3.4% in Rabat, Morocco, highlighting disparities in outcomes.\n\nThese studies demonstrate that survival rates for Stage 4 lung cancer are generally low, but have been improving with advancements in treatment, particularly immunotherapy and targeted therapies. However, these improvements are not universal and depend on factors like access to care, specific cancer subtypes, and individual patient characteristics.\n\nConsidering the patient's specific situation \u2013 recurrent disease, progression despite two lines of therapy (including immunotherapy), PD-L1 negative status, and age of 68 \u2013 her prognosis is unfortunately less favorable than the average reported in these studies. While immunotherapy has improved outcomes for *some* patients with Stage 4 NSCLC, it was ineffective in this case. The patient has already experienced disease progression despite treatment, indicating a more aggressive disease course.\n\nGiven these factors, the probability of survival beyond 12 months is significantly reduced.\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"
