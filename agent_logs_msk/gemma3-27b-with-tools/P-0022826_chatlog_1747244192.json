The 5-year recurrence rate for stage 2 pancreatic cancer (which includes 2B) is reported to be between 60-80%. However, several factors influence recurrence risk, including the completeness of resection (R0 vs. R1/R2), lymph node involvement, and pathological features. MSS status is generally associated with a lower response rate to immunotherapy, and TMB, while potentially informative, doesn't drastically alter the overall recurrence risk in the absence of specific actionable mutations. The fact that the CT scans have been stable is a positive sign, but doesn't eliminate the risk. The relatively low CA 19-9 level is also encouraging, but CA 19-9 is not a perfect marker and can sometimes be normal even with disease.\n\nGiven the stage, the inherent risk of recurrence for pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and the limited timeframe (6 months), I believe there is a reasonable probability of recurrence.\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"

METHODS: Patients with a performance status of 0 or 1 were enrolled to receive interferon-alfa-2b (3 million units MWF), cisplatin (30 mg/m(2), 6 doses) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU; 175 mg/m(2)/day), concurrent with external-beam radiation (50.4 Gy) and followed by 2 courses of systemic 5-FU. The protocol was modified to include an optional 9 day break in the middle of chemoradiation. Quality of life was assessed by use of validated instruments. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were eligible for analysis. The operation of 15 (54%) patients was performed at other institutions. All patients had T3 tumors, 22 (79%) had positive lymph nodes and 4 (14%) had positive (R1) margins. 24 (86%) patients completed therapy. In all, 25 (89%) patients experienced grade 3 toxicity and 3 (11%) patients were hospitalized. The most common grade 3 events were leukopenia (15, 54%) and neutropenia (12, 43%). No grade 4 toxicity occurred. Overall quality of life decreased during chemoradiation but returned to baseline thereafter and was stable throughout surveillance. 19 patients have died; the median follow-up of the 9 survivors is 62 months. The median OS duration of treated patients was 42.3 (95% confidence interval 30.5-54.2) months. CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant interferon-based chemoradiation can be delivered safely and tolerably-though with substantial reversible toxicity-to patients of good performance status at an experienced cancer center.

METHODS: Patients who underwent pancreatectomy for invasive ductal carcinoma of the pancreas between January 2007 and December 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. The prognostic significance of MVI was analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 352 patients underwent pancreatectomy for invasive ductal carcinoma of the pancreas. A pathologic examination showed MVI in 228 (64.5%) of the patients. The median survival time (MST) was 21 months for the patients with MVI and 58 months for those without MVI (p < 0.001). A multivariate analysis showed the following to be significant prognostic factors: non-administration of adjuvant chemotherapy [hazard ratio (HR) 2.37; p < 0.001], lymph node metastasis (HR 2.95; p = 0.001), CA19-9 value of 300 U/ml or higher (HR 1.70; p = 0.018), and MVI (HR 1.84; p = 0.011). The overall survival was clearly stratified into three groups; favorable (MST not reached in stage 1 or 2A without MVI; p = 0.867), moderate (30 months in stage 2A with MVI and 30 months in stage 2B without MVI; p = 0.528), and poor (19 months in stage 2B with MVI and 17 months in stage 4; p = 0.322). The differences between these three groups all were significant. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately two-thirds of patients with radiologically resectable pancreatic cancer had MVI and were considered to have potentially systemic disease. This study identified MVI as one of the significant factors for a poor prognosis and a valuable complement of tumor-node-metastasis staging.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 9164539\nTitle: Simultaneous hepatic resection with pancreato-duodenectomy for metastatic pancreatic head carcinoma: does it improve survival?\nAuthors: Takada T, Yasuda H, Amano H\nJournal: Hepato-gastroenterology\nPublication Date: 1997 Mar-Apr\nAbstract: BACKGROUND/AIMS: To determine whether aggressive surgery, consisting of a simultaneous pancreatic and partial hepatic resection, for patients with an invasive metastatic ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head improves the postoperative outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 109 patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head were divided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of 33 patients with liver metastasis and Group 2 consisted of 76 patients without liver metastasis. Group 1 was further subdivided into 11 patients(Group 1-A) to aggressive surgery, consisting of pancreatoduodenectomy and partial liver resection, and 22 patients to palliative bypass surgery(group 1-B). Group 2 was subdivided into 37 patients to pancreatoduodenectomy(group 2-A), and 39 patients to bypass surgery(group 2-B). RESULTS: No significant statistical differences were seen in the outcomes between Group 1-A (median survival period: 6 months) and Group 1-B (median survival period: 4 months). Further, all Group 1-A patients died from multiple recurrent liver metastasis within a year. In addition, the outcomes of Group 1-A were significantly poorer than that of 2-A patients(median survival period: 24 months). CONCLUSION: Patients who underwent an aggressive simultaneous resection of primary and metastatic hepatic lesion did not exhibit any improvement. However, it is anticipated that these findings will provide insights into developing an effective adjuvant therapy to impede or destroy macroscopic/occult liver metastasis.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

RB also plays an important role in the regulation of apoptosis, which is mediated by interaction of p53 signaling mediators. The present study was designed to assess the clinicopathological significance of RB and p53 pathway-related proteins (p53, p21WAF1/CIP1 and Bax) expression in resectable invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) of the pancreas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study included 79 pancreatic IDC patients, who received surgery between 1982 and 2002. The expression of RB and p53 pathway-related proteins (p53, p21WAF1/CIP1 and Bax) were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: RB was expressed in 45 (57%) of the 79 patients. RB expression correlated significantly with histological grade and grade of nodal involvement. The positive rate of p53, p21WAF1/CIP1 and Bax expression was 49%, 48% and 67%, respectively. RB expression alone did not have a significant effect on patient survival. However, coexpression analysis of RB and p53 pathway-related proteins indicated that, in the patients with RB (+) IDC, the p21WAF1/CIP1 (+) group had a significantly higher survival rate than the p21WAF1/CIP1 (-) group. On the other hand, in the patients with RB (-) IDC, the Bax (+) group had a significantly higher survival rate than the Bax (-) group. Multivariate analysis indicated that, in the RB (-) group, pTNM stage, adjuvant chemotherapy and Bax expression were significant variables. CONCLUSION: The evaluation of RB expression combined with the mediators of the p53 pathway, p21WAF1/CIP1 and Bax, may provide more accurate information regarding clinical outcome, beyond that which is provided by RB expression alone.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Oxaliplatin: Oxaliplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nCapecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers. Capecitabine is a prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to fluorouracil (antimetabolite) in the tumor, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor tissue.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0022826-T01-IM6\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0022826\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Pancreatic Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Pancreas\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT468\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 594, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 10.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"PAAD\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1996 and January 2001, 33 consecutive patients (18 males and 15 women, mean age 63 years) with locally advanced PA were treated with chemotherapy and concurrent external-beam radiotherapy. Radiotherapy delivered 45-50.4 Gy, in a classical manner (N=27) or on a split-course (N=6). Chemotherapy was made of 5FU by continuous infusion for all patients during 5 weeks and cisplatin at the 1st and 5th weeks (N=22). Tumor resectability was reassessed at the end of the chemoradiotherapy; surgical resection of tumour was attempted in patients whose tumor demonstrated reduction in size, and supplementary radiotherapy of 10 to 15 Gy was delivered to the others. RESULTS: Thirty-nine percent of patients experienced grade 3 acute toxicity. WHO criteria response to chemoradiotherapy four weeks after the end of treatment were: 4 partial responders (12%), 6 minor responders (18%), 14 stable disease (42%), 9 progression (28%). Ten patients underwent exploratory laparotomy, in one case vascular encasement did not allow for tumor resection, and in another patient, there was peritoneal carcinomatosis. In the 8 remaining patients, surgical (R0) resection was possible. In one patient histological examination showed fibrosis with no residual tumour. After a median follow-up period of 40 months, median survival was 16 months (66% and 37% of survival at 1 and 2 years respectively). In operated and non-operated patients, survival rates at 24 months were 73% and 12.5% respectively. At 1 year, 80% of the patients treated with radiochemotherapy developed recurrence, metastatic recurrence in 88%. Initial laparotomy, split course radiotherapy were poor outcome factors whereas chemotherapy appears to be a favorable outcome factor. CONCLUSION: Subsequent resection of locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma is possible after chemoradiotherapy allowing for a prolonged survival in some patients.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 38291249\nTitle: A case of metachronous oligo-hepatic and peritoneal metastases of pancreatic cancer with a favorable outcome after conversion surgery combined with perioperative sequential chemotherapy.\nAuthors: Tohyama T, Tanno Y, Murakami T\nJournal: Clinical journal of gastroenterology\nPublication Date: 2024 Apr\nAbstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive malignancies, and the prognosis for its recurrence after surgery is very poor. Here, we report a case of metachronous oligo-hepatic and peritoneal metastases in a patient who survived without recurrence for 3 years after conversion surgery combined with perioperative sequential chemotherapy using gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel (GnP) and modified FOLFIRINOX (mFOLFIRINOX). The patient was a 70-year-old man with pancreatic ductal carcinoma, classified as cT3N0M0, cStage IIA, who underwent a distal pancreatosplenectomy. At 1 year and 4 months later, two liver metastases and one peritoneal metastasis were detected. A systemic 9-month course of chemotherapy was administered with GnP and mFOLFIRINOX as the first- and second-line chemotherapeutic agents, respectively. The two liver metastases were judged as showing a partial response, but one dissemination was considered stable disease. After receiving informed consent from the patient, we performed resection of the disseminated tumor and lateral segmentectomy of the liver. Adjuvant chemotherapy using mFOLFIRINOX and GnP was administered for 10 months. The patient has now been alive for 5 years and 6 months after the initial pancreatosplenectomy, and 3 years and 3 months after the conversion surgery, without subsequent tumor recurrence. Thus, a multidisciplinary treatment approach including surgery and perioperative sequential chemotherapy using GnP and mFOLFIRINOX may be beneficial for treating metachronous oligo-hepatic and peritoneal metastases, depending on the patient's condition.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 29394807\nTitle: [A Case of Successful Adjuvant Surgery for the Pancreas Head Cancer with Peritoneal Metastasis].\nAuthors: Kyakumoto Y, Takadate T, Mizuma M\nJournal: Gan to kagaku ryoho. Cancer & chemotherapy\nPublication Date: 2017 Nov\nAbstract: We report a case of the pancreas head cancer with peritoneal metastasis, which was resected curatively after chemotherapy. A6 6-year-old male was referred to our hospital for the treatment of biliary stenosis. The serum CA19-9 level was elevated and abdominal CT scan showed stenosis of distal bile duct. By laparotomy, we noticed mass in the head of the pancreas with 8mm of the seeding nodule in a diameter at jejunal mesentery which was diagnosed as adenocarcinoma by intraoperative frozen sections. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed as pancreas head cancer with peritoneal metastasis. After hepaticojejunostomy, we started chemotherapy planning adjuvant surgery if the clinical response was observed. Systemic chemotherapy with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel was administrated on days 1, 8 and 15 every 4 weeks. After 5 courses, therapeutic effect was stable disease(SD)in response evaluation criteria in solid tumor(RECIST). All of tumor markers were normalized. Subtotal stomach-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy(SSPPD)was performed 6 months after the initial surgery. Histopathologically, most cancer cells showed degeneration and eliminated in the head of the pancreas. R0 resection was achieved with diagnosis of ypT3, ypN1, pM1(PER), Stage IV . Histological therapeutic effect was Grade III according to the Evans classification. The patient is alive, with no sign of recurrence 8 months after surgery. Adjuvant surgery was suggested to be one of the therapeutic options for pancreatic cancer with peritoneal metastasis.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

The absence of recurrence for over a year is a positive prognostic factor, but doesn't guarantee continued disease-free survival.\n\nGiven the balance of evidence, I believe the probability of recurrence within the next 12 months is still present, but reduced. However, I will lean towards a \"No\" answer, acknowledging the significant period of stability.\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"

Despite advances in diagnostic and therapeutic modalities, the outcome and prognosis of PDAC remain poor. Most patients have locally advanced disease (30%-35%) or distant metastases (50%-55%) at the time of diagnosis. The treatment of unresectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (UR-PDAC) remains an urgent problem. In this study, we report that a patient with UR-PDAC underwent significant tumor shrinkage after PD-1 inhibitor combination chemotherapy, and obtained R0 (pathologically negative margin) resection and long-term survival. CASE PRESENTATION: A 51-year-old woman was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer (stage III). She underwent 3 cycles of preoperative neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody in combination with chemotherapy and the tumor shrank from 4.0 x 3.3 cm to 0.9 cm without significant adverse effects. The patient underwent conversion surgery (CS) and achieved R0 resection, and no tumor cells remained as confirmed by pathology. CONCLUSION: PD-1 antibody combination chemotherapy regimens have significant efficacy and do not add additional side effects in UR-PDAC patients, heralding advances in UR-PDAC treatment. We may have a way to give UR-PDAC patients access to curative treatment and long-term survival. This case of UR-PDAC patient with PD-L1-negative and microsatellite stability (MSS) gives us a more comprehensive understanding of the treatment options of immune-combination chemotherapy.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 36203575\nTitle: Case report: Two PD-L1 positive unresectable advanced pancreatic carcinoma patients with microsatellite stability achieved R0 resection after PD-1 antibody plus chemotherapy as a successful downstaging therapy: A report of two cases.\nAuthors: Shang L, Li P, Fan J\nJournal: Frontiers in immunology\nPublication Date: 2022\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Nonobvious early symptoms are a prominent characteristic of pancreatic cancer, resulting in only 20% of patients having resectable tumors at the time of diagnosis. The optimal management of unresectable advanced pancreatic cancer (UAPC) remains an open research question. In this study, the tumors shrank significantly after PD-1 antibody combined with chemotherapy in two UAPC patients, and both have achieved R0 (pathologically negative margin) resection and survival to date. CASE PRESENTATION: Case 1: A 53-year-old man was diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Stage III). He received six cycles of PD-1 antibody plus chemotherapy as the first-line treatment. The tumor was reduced from 11.8x8.8 cm to \"0\" (the pancreatic head was normal as shown by enhanced computed tomography, ECT) after preoperative neoadjuvant therapy (PNT) and the adverse effects were tolerable. The patient underwent radical surgery and achieved R0 resection. Case 2: A 43-year-old man diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinoma with liver metastasis (Stage IV) received three cycles of PD-1 antibody combined with chemotherapy. The tumor was reduced from 5.2x3.9 cm to 2.4x2.3 cm with no side effects. The patient also underwent radical surgery and achieved R0 resection. CONCLUSION: PD-1 antibody plus a chemotherapy regimen resulted in a surprising curative effect and safety in two patients with UAPC, which may portend an improvement in pancreatic carcinoma treatment. We may have a way for UAPC patients to obtain radical treatment and gain long-term survival. Two PD-L1 positive UAPC patients with microsatellite stability (MSS) enlighten us to have a more comprehensive understanding of the prediction of immunotherapy.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 32569179\nTitle: Resection for pancreatic cancer metastases contributes to survival: A case report with sequential tumor genotype profiling during the long-term postoperative course.\nAuthors: Sato H, Sasajima J, Okada T\nJournal: Medicine\nPublication Date: 2020 Jun 19\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION: Surgical management is not a standard treatment option for metastatic recurrence of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. However, the surgical management of a solitary metastasis is useful in selected cases. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 42-year-old woman was referred to our hospital on account of epigastric pain associated with a mass in the pancreatic body. The patient had a family history of branch duct-type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) complicated with pancreatitis due to pancreatic duct involvement. INTERVENTIONS: The patient underwent distal pancreatectomy, and pathological examination revealed a tubular adenocarcinoma. Solitary liver and lung metastatic tumors were found 6 and 43 months after the initial presentation, respectively, and sequential metastasectomies were performed. OUTCOMES: The patient survived until 8 years after her initial presentation. The genetic profiles of the resected specimens, primary PDA, and recurrent tumors in the liver and lung possessed identical KRAS mutations at codon 12, whereas there were no mutations in the main tumor suppressor genes, such as TP53, CDKN2A, and SMAD4. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based microsatellite instability assay demonstrated microsatellite stability. CONCLUSION: In our case, the patient with pancreatic adenocarcinoma survived for over 8 years following the resection of the primary tumor and resections of metachronous metastatic tumors. The outcome of PDA may be associated with the genetic profile that regulates its biological behavior. Operative management of solitary metastatic tumors may be a therapeutic options for selected patients with pancreatic cancer.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
