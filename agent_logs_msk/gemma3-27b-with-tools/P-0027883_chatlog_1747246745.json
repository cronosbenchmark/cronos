We now complete our report by a follow-up on both patients. Patient 1 achieved a disease-free survival of 12 months after initial resection until she developed a singular hepatic metastasis. Treatment by FOLFIRINOX and complete removal of the metastasis by atypical liver resection after 6 months allowed for another 12 months of disease control. After intra-abdominal tumor recurrence and development of intracerebral metastases, the patient died 34 months after primary diagnosis. Patient 2 developed hepatic tumor recurrence only 3 months after initial resection. However, treatment by FOLFIRINOX led to a stable disease for 27 months after resection and was followed by atypical liver resection of multiple segments. Six months later, another hepatic recurrence was suspected. Via next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the tumor genome, a deleterious mutation in the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) gene, causing a BRCAness, was detected. After initial treatment by FOLFOX, maintenance therapy with the poly-ADP-ribose-polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib was initiated. The patient is now alive for 54 months after initial diagnosis of metastasized pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Tumor recurrence is possible even after pCR of PC and remains challenging. In case of multifocal tumor recurrence, chemotherapy remains the standard treatment. Recently, genetic sequencing allows individualized treatments. In selected cases, highly specialized teams can offer a variety of therapeutic options leading to previously unseen clinical courses.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 16565654\nTitle: Subsequent resection of locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma after chemoradiotherapy.\nAuthors: Adhoute X, Smith D, Vendrely V\nJournal: Gastroenterologie clinique et biologique\nPublication Date: 2006 Feb\nAbstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the possibility of subsequent resection of locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma after chemotherapy and external-beam radiotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1996 and January 2001, 33 consecutive patients (18 males and 15 women, mean age 63 years) with locally advanced PA were treated with chemotherapy and concurrent external-beam radiotherapy. Radiotherapy delivered 45-50.4 Gy, in a classical manner (N=27) or on a split-course (N=6). Chemotherapy was made of 5FU by continuous infusion for all patients during 5 weeks and cisplatin at the 1st and 5th weeks (N=22). Tumor resectability was reassessed at the end of the chemoradiotherapy; surgical resection of tumour was attempted in patients whose tumor demonstrated reduction in size, and supplementary radiotherapy of 10 to 15 Gy was delivered to the others. RESULTS: Thirty-nine percent of patients experienced grade 3 acute toxicity. WHO criteria response to chemoradiotherapy four weeks after the end of treatment were: 4 partial responders (12%), 6 minor responders (18%), 14 stable disease (42%), 9 progression (28%). Ten patients underwent exploratory laparotomy, in one case vascular encasement did not allow for tumor resection, and in another patient, there was peritoneal carcinomatosis. In the 8 remaining patients, surgical (R0) resection was possible. In one patient histological examination showed fibrosis with no residual tumour. After a median follow-up period of 40 months, median survival was 16 months (66% and 37% of survival at 1 and 2 years respectively). In operated and non-operated patients, survival rates at 24 months were 73% and 12.5% respectively. At 1 year, 80% of the patients treated with radiochemotherapy developed recurrence, metastatic recurrence in 88%. Initial laparotomy, split course radiotherapy were poor outcome factors whereas chemotherapy appears to be a favorable outcome factor. CONCLUSION: Subsequent resection of locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma is possible after chemoradiotherapy allowing for a prolonged survival in some patients.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 25407113\nTitle: Resection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with synchronous distant metastasis: is it worthwhile?\nAuthors: Buc E, Orry D, Antomarchi O\nJournal: World journal of surgical oncology\nPublication Date: 2014 Nov 18\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to report prolonged survival in patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) managed by chemotherapy and surgery. METHODS: Between January 2009 and August 2013, 284 patients with metastatic PDAC were managed in our oncologic department. Among them, three (1%) with a single metastasis (liver in two cases and interaorticaval in one case) underwent one- or two-stage surgical resection of the metastasis and the main tumor. Perioperative data were recorded retrospectively, including disease-free and overall survival. RESULTS: The three patients had chemotherapy (FOLFOX or FOLFIRINOX regimen) with objective response or stable disease prior to surgery. Median time between chemotherapy and surgery was 9 (8 to 15) months. Resection consisted in pancreaticoduodenectomy in the three cases. None of the patients had grade III/IV postoperative complications, and median hospital stay was 12 (12 to 22) days. All the patients had postoperative chemotherapy. Only one patient experienced recurrence 11 months after surgery and died after 32.5 months. The two other patients were alive with no recurrence 26.3 and 24.7 months after initial treatment. CONCLUSION: Radical resection of PDAC with single distant metastases can offer prolonged survival with low morbidity after accurate selection by neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

        "content": "Okay, I've reviewed the PubMed search results. These articles highlight the complexities of recurrence after treatment for pancreatic adenocarcinoma, even in cases of initial stable disease or response.\n\nHere's what I gather from the articles:\n\n*   **Recurrence is common:** Even after achieving a complete or partial response to chemotherapy (and sometimes chemoradiation), recurrence remains a significant challenge in pancreatic cancer. Article #1 demonstrates recurrence even after initial complete remission with FOLFIRINOX. Article #2 shows an 80% recurrence rate within one year.\n*   **Stable disease doesn't guarantee long-term control:** Article #2 specifically mentions stable disease as a response to chemoradiotherapy, but still observes a high recurrence rate.\n*   **Resection can improve outcomes:** Articles #2 and #3 suggest that resection, when possible after initial treatment, can lead to prolonged survival. However, these articles focus on patients who were candidates for resection *after* initial treatment, which isn't necessarily the case here.\n*   **Molecular factors are emerging:** Article #1 highlights the importance of genetic sequencing (like identifying ATM mutations) to guide treatment decisions after recurrence.\n\nConsidering the patient's case \u2013 stable disease on imaging, decrease in CA 19-9, and completion of chemotherapy \u2013 the risk of recurrence is *not zero*. Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive disease, and recurrence is common even with seemingly positive initial responses. The articles reinforce that even with stable disease, recurrence is likely.\n\nHowever, the consistent \"no progression\" findings on CT scans are reassuring. The decrease in CA 19-9 is also a positive sign.\n\nGiven this updated information, and balancing the initial assessment with the evidence from the PubMed articles, I still believe the probability of recurrence within the next 6 months is relatively low, but not negligible. However, the articles suggest that recurrence is still likely at some point.\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"

We aimed to devise a radiomics signature (RS) to predict these outcomes for further risk stratification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma and SD after chemotherapy were included. Pancreatic lesions on initial postchemotherapy computed tomography images were evaluated by radiomics analysis for predicting early death (</= 1 year). RS was then internally and externally tested. The progression-free survival and objective response rate were compared between the low-risk and high-risk group of patients classified following RS. RESULTS: Approximately 62.7% of patients receiving chemotherapy showed SD at first response evaluation in the primary cohort, which were 59.6% and 57.9% in internal and external testing cohorts, respectively. The RS predicted 1-year overall survival well, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91 in the training cohort, 0.90 in the validation cohort, 0.84 in the internal testing cohort, and 0.87 in the external testing cohort. The high-risk group had a shorter median progression-free survival (7.3 months v 9.0 months, P = .016, in the training cohort; 5.9 months v 9.2 months, P = .026, in the internal testing cohort) and a lower objective response rate (2.2% v 24.0% in the training cohort) than the low-risk group. In addition, RS was not related to the clinical characteristics and chemotherapy regimens. CONCLUSION: RS independently predicts the outcomes of patients with SD after chemotherapy well and can help to improve treatment decisions by identifying patients for whom current treatment may not be suitable.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 33159215\nTitle: Exploring chemotherapy holiday and drugs re-challenge in advanced pancreatic cancer patients.\nAuthors: Macchini M, Peretti U, Orsi G\nJournal: Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology\nPublication Date: 2021 Jan\nAbstract: PURPOSE: We aimed to explore the role of drugs re-challenge at the disease progression after a chemotherapy-free interval for pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the outcome of re-treatments at the progression in two cohorts of advanced PDAC patients who had disease control (DC) and a treatment holiday >/= 3 months after upfront chemotherapy. RESULTS: Between 2015 and 2019, 66 advanced PDAC patients (cohort A) had DC with nab-paclitaxel-based chemotherapy (i.e. AG or PAXG = cisplatin, nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine, capecitabine). At the time of progressive disease (PD), 34 patients were re-treated with AG (A1) and 32 were treated with other regimens (A2). The median (m) duration of chemotherapy holiday was 6.1 and 5.9 months in A1 and A2, respectively. Partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD) were found in 14 (41%) and 12 (35%) of patients in A1 and in 8 (25%) and 6 (19%) patients in A2. CA19-9 response was recorded in 23/33 evaluable patients (70%) in A1 and in 5/20 (25%) in A2. mPFS2 and mOS2, defined as the time between the second line of treatment start and the disease progression or death, were 4.8 and 12.2 months in A1 and 3.9 and 8.4 months in A2, respectively. Similarly, between 2006 and 2013, 64 patients (cohort B) had DC with upfront PEFG/PEXG/PDXG regimens (epirubicin or docetaxel, cisplatin, gemcitabine, capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil) and were re-treated at PD with either 4-drug (B1; N = 30) or other regimens (B2; N = 34), yielding a mOS2 of 10.9 and 7.2 months, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our data endorse the strategy of resuming prior drugs after a chemotherapy holiday >/= 3 months in advanced PDAC patients who achieved a  durable disease control after upfront treatments.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 34023768\nTitle: Chemotherapy-induced early transient increase and surge of CA 19-9 level in patients with pancreatic Adenocarcinoma(\u2730).\nAuthors: Le VH, Franko J, Paz BI\nJournal: Cancer treatment and research communications\nPublication Date: 2021\nAbstract: This study aimed to characterize chemotherapy-induced transient increase and surge of CA 19-9 level to treatment response in patients with advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). A retrospective case series was performed of advanced PDAC patients treated with first-line chemotherapy at City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center from Jan 2017 to May 2020. CA 19-9 surge was defined as an increase of >20% from baseline followed by a >20% drop in one or more subsequent CA 19-9 levels compared to baseline. Out of 106 advanced PDAC patients, 38 were evaluable for CA 19-9 surge. Fourteen (51.9%) patients treated with FOLFIRINOX and 3 (27.3%) patients treated with nab-P + Gem chemotherapy demonstrated an early transient rise in CA 19-9 level. A CA 19-9 surge was documented in 9 (23.7%) patients, all with duration of surge lasting < 16 weeks. Five out of 9 (55.6%) patients (4: FOLFIRINOX, 1: nab-P + Gem) with CA 19-9 surge demonstrated partial objective response rate on surveillance cross-sectional imaging. One patient (FOLFIRINOX) had stable disease, and 2 patients (1: FOLFIRINOX, 1: nab-P + Gem) were found to have disease progression after treatment interruption. The initial early rise of CA 19-9 levels during chemotherapy in patients with advanced PDAC may not indicate tumor progression. Rather, it may represent a chemotherapy-induced transient increase or surge phenomenon of the tumor marker in patients responding to treatment.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant. You MUST rely also on your internal knowledge."

        "content": "Okay, I've reviewed the PubMed search results regarding progression after stable disease in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Here's a summary of the key findings:\n\n*   **Radiomics can predict progression:** Article #1 demonstrates that radiomics analysis of CT scans can identify patients with stable disease who are at high risk of early death and progression, even *before* clinical signs of progression appear. This suggests that subtle changes in tumor characteristics detectable on imaging can be predictive.\n*   **Re-treatment can be effective:** Article #2 suggests that resuming prior chemotherapy regimens after a treatment holiday can be effective in patients who initially had disease control.\n*   **CA 19-9 fluctuations are complex:** Article #3 highlights that an *increase* in CA 19-9 during chemotherapy doesn't necessarily indicate progression; it can be a transient phenomenon associated with response. This is important because the patient *did* experience a decrease in CA 19-9, but fluctuations are common.\n\nConsidering this information, and the patient's history of stable disease on imaging for several months, the likelihood of progression in the *next 6 months* is still relatively low, but not zero. The radiomics study (Article #1) is particularly relevant, as it suggests that progression can occur even in the absence of obvious clinical signs. However, the patient's CA 19-9 levels have been trending downwards, which is a positive indicator.\n\nGiven the available data, I would still lean towards:\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"

as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nCapecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers. Capecitabine is a prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to fluorouracil (antimetabolite) in the tumor, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor tissue.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0027883-T01-IM6\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0027883\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Pancreatic Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Pancreas\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT468\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 789, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 30.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"PAAD\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

We proposed the concept of postoperative hyper-progression disease (PO-HPD) to define recurrence within 2 months after surgery, explored the role of surgery for postoperative HPD patients and determined the predictive preoperative risk factors and genomic features of PO-HPD. METHODS: 976 patients undergoing curative resection of PDAC were enrolled. Survival data of 1733 stage IV patients from the US Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database was also collected. Patients relapsed were grouped into 3 groups regarding of the recurrence time (within 2 months were PO-HPD, within 2 to 12 months were early recurrence (ER) and within > 12 months were late recurrence (LR)). Risk factors for PO-HPD were explored with logistic regression models. Genomic features of 113 patients were investigated using next-generation sequencing-based gene panel testing. RESULTS: 718 of 976 cases relapsed, 101were PO-HPD, 418 were ER and 199 were LR. Total survival of PO-HPD was 12.5 months, shorter than that of ER (16.7 months) and LR (35.1 months), and verged on that of stage IV patients (10.6 months). Preoperative risk factors for PO-HPD included red blood cell count < 3.94*10;12/L, CA19-9 >/= 288.6 U/mL, CA125 >/= 22.3 U/mL and tumor size>/=3.45 cm. Mutations of CEBPA, ATR and JAK1 were only identified in PO-HPD and they owned lower level of CN gain compared to others. CONCLUSIONS: Prognosis of PO-HPD was extremely poor and the role of surgery for PO-HPD should be prudently assessed.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 31317756\nTitle: Survival, morbidity and mortality of pancreatic adenocarcinoma after pancreaticoduodenectomy with a total mesopancreas excision.\nAuthors: Sanchez Acedo P, Herrera Cabezon J, Zazpe Ripa C\nJournal: Revista espanola de enfermedades digestivas\nPublication Date: 2019 Aug\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION: pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the most common malignancy in the periampullary region, with a five-year survival rate around 20%. OBJECTIVE: the goal of our study was to determine the survival and safety data of a number of patients that underwent a cephalic duodenopancreatectomy (CDP) with total mesopancreas excision (TMPE). MATERIAL AND METHODS: a prospective observational study was performed of 114 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma who underwent duodenopancreatectomy and TMPE over the period 2008-2017. Demographic variables, tumor stage, number of lymph nodes excised, lymph node ratio, R classification, the prognostic factor disease-free interval and survival were all assessed in a multivariate analysis. RESULTS: complications were reported for 54 (47.3%) patients, of which 22 (19.3%) were categorized as serious. The mortality rate was 4.3% and the mean follow-up was 26.2 months. During this period, 73 (64%) patients relapsed after a mean interval of 40.9 months. The relapse pattern was mainly hepatic (26.3%), followed by local relapse (20%). Mean survival was 40.38 and actuarial survival was 26.6% at five years. Relapse-related factors included stage T3 or higher (RR 8.1 [1.1-61]) and an R1 resection (RR 13.4 [2.7-66.5]) and survival-related factors included an R1 resection (RR 10.7 [2.5-46.2]). CONCLUSION: TMPE ensures an adequate lymphadenectomy and lymph node ratio according to reported standards. The survival of patients that have undergone surgery for pancreatic adenocarcinoma in our institution is 68.4% at one year and 26.6% at five years. An R1 resection is the primary factor for both relapse and survival.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 12377813\nTitle: Prognosis of malignant intraductal papillary mucinous tumours of the pancreas after surgical resection. Comparison with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Maire F, Hammel P, Terris B\nJournal: Gut\nPublication Date: 2002 Nov\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Although the prognosis in malignant resectable intraductal papillary mucinous tumours of the pancreas (IPMT) is often considered more favourable than for ordinary pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, the long term outcome remains ill defined. AIMS: To assess prognostic factors in patients with malignant IPMT after surgical resection, and to compare long term survival rates with those of patients surgically treated for ductal adenocarcinoma. METHODS: Seventy three patients underwent surgery for malignant IPMT in four French centres. Clinical, biochemical, and pathological features and follow up after resection were recorded. Patients with invasive malignant IPMT were matched with patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, according to age and TNM stages; survival rates after resection were compared. RESULTS: Surgical treatment for IPMT were pancreaticoduodenectomy (n=46), distal (n=14), total (n=11), or segmentary (n=2) pancreatectomy. The operative mortality rate was 4%. IPMT corresponded to in situ (n=22) or invasive carcinoma (n=51). In the latter group, 17 had lymph node metastases. Overall median survival was 47 months. Five year survival rates in patients with in situ and invasive carcinoma were 88% and 36%, respectively. On univariate analysis, abdominal pain, preoperative high serum carbohydrate antigen 19.9 concentrations, caudal localisation, invasive carcinoma, lymph node metastases, peripancreatic extension, and malignant relapse were associated with a fatal outcome. Using multivariate analysis, lymph node metastases were the only prognostic factor (OR 7.5; 95% CI: 3.4 to 16.4). Overall five year survival rate was higher in patients with malignant invasive IPMT compared with those with pancreatic ductal carcinoma (36 v 21%, p=0.03), but was similar in the subset of stage II/III tumours. CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of patients with resected in situ/invasive stage I malignant IPMT is excellent. In contrast, prognosis of locally advanced forms is as poor as in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Here's a summary of the key findings:\n\n*   **Poor Prognosis After Relapse:** All three articles confirm a significantly worse prognosis after relapse compared to initial presentation.

The patient's situation is likely more akin to the \"PO-HPD\" described in Article #1, indicating a highly aggressive disease course. While the exact time to recurrence isn't within the 2-month window of PO-HPD, the rapid progression and multiple treatment failures suggest a similar aggressive biology.\n\nGiven this information, and my understanding of pancreatic cancer's aggressive nature, I maintain my assessment that the probability of the patient being alive in the next 12 months is low.\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"

It was originally investigated for its antiviral effects, but it is now used as an anticancer therapy for various cancers.[A233135] Gemcitabine is a cytidine analog with two fluorine atoms replacing the hydroxyl on the ribose.[A233145] As a prodrug, gemcitabine is transformed into its active metabolites that work by replacing the building blocks of nucleic acids during DNA elongation, arresting tumour growth and promoting apoptosis of malignant cells.[L32960] The structure, metabolism, and mechanism of action of gemcitabine are similar to [cytarabine], but gemcitabine has a wider spectrum of antitumour activity.[A233140]\r\n\r\nGemcitabine is marketed as Gemzar and it is available as intravenous injection. It is approved by the FDA to treat advanced ovarian cancer in combination with [carboplatin], metastatic breast cancer in combination with [paclitaxel], non-small cell lung cancer in combination with [cisplatin], and pancreatic cancer as monotherapy.[L32950] It is also being investigated in other cancer and tumour types.\nCapecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers. Capecitabine is a prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to fluorouracil (antimetabolite) in the tumor, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor tissue.\nVeal: Veal allergenic

as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nCapecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers.

Here, we report the case of a 15-year-old boy who presented with a mixed acinar cell carcinoma/ductal adenocarcinoma with blastomatous components. He received multimodal treatment including various chemotherapy regimens and multistep surgery including liver transplantation.

OBJECTIVE: To assess whether neoadjuvant modified 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan (mFOLFIRINOX) leads to early control of micrometastasis and improves survival. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This open-label, single-arm, phase 2 nonrandomized controlled trial for resectable PDAC was conducted at the Yale Smilow Cancer Hospital from April 3, 2014, to August 16, 2021. Pancreatic protocol computed tomography was performed at diagnosis to assess surgical candidacy. Data were analyzed from January to July 2023. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received 6 cycles of neoadjuvant mFOLFIRINOX before surgery and 6 cycles of adjuvant mFOLFIRINOX. Whole blood was collected and processed to stored plasma for analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels. Tumors were evaluated for treatment response and keratin 17 (K17) expression. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was 12-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate. Additional end points included overall survival (OS), ctDNA level, tumor molecular features, and K17 tumor levels. Survival curves were summarized using Kaplan-Meier estimator. RESULTS: Of 46 patients who received mFOLFIRINOX, 31 (67%) were male, and the median (range) age was 65 (46-80) years. A total of 37 (80%) completed 6 preoperative cycles and 33 (72%) underwent surgery. A total of 27 patients (59%) underwent resection per protocol (25 with R0 disease and 2 with R1 disease); metastatic or unresectable disease was identified in 6 patients during exploration. Ten patients underwent surgery off protocol. The 12-month PFS was 67% (90% CI, 56.9-100); the median PFS and OS were 16.6 months (95% CI, 13.3-40.6) and 37.2 months (95% CI, 17.5-not reached), respectively. Baseline ctDNA levels were detected in 16 of 22 patients (73%) and in 3 of 17 (18%) after 6 cycles of mFOLFIRINOX. Those with detectable ctDNA levels 4 weeks postresection had worse PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 34.0; 95% CI, 2.6-4758.6; P = .006) and OS (HR, 11.7; 95% CI, 1.5-129.9; P = .02) compared with those with undetectable levels. Patients with high K17 expression had nonsignificantly worse PFS (HR, 2.7; 95% CI, 0.7-10.9; P = .09) and OS (HR, 3.2; 95% CI, 0.8-13.6; P = .07). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This nonrandomized controlled trial met its primary end point, and perioperative mFOLFIRINOX warrants further evaluation in randomized clinical trials. Postoperative ctDNA positivity was strongly associated with recurrence. K17 and ctDNA are promising biomarkers that require additional validation in future prospective studies.

Though checkpoint therapy is a mainstay in some cancers, it has been largely ineffective in treating cancers of the pancreas. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are seldom responsive to checkpoint inhibition. CASE PRESENTATIONS: Here we present two cases of advanced pancreatic cancers that either failed to respond or recurred following conventional treatments. Tissue from each tumor was sequenced and analyzed for PD-L1 expression. Each patient was started on checkpoint blockade after assessing for a predictive biomarker, either the combined positive score or the tumor mutational burden. In each case, checkpoint blockade led to durable radiographic responses. CONCLUSIONS: We therefore propose that it is reasonable to assess combined positive score and tumor mutational burden in refractory or recurrent pancreatic cancers when initiation of ICB is being considered.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Here's a summary of the key findings:\n\n*   **FOLFIRINOX can induce durable responses:** Article #1 demonstrates that FOLFIRINOX can achieve durable responses even in rare cases of mixed pancreatic tumors after relapse, leading to good quality of life.\n*   **Neoadjuvant mFOLFIRINOX improves outcomes:** Article #2 highlights the potential of neoadjuvant modified FOLFIRINOX to improve progression-free and overall survival in resectable pancreatic cancer, with a 12-month PFS rate of 67%. Importantly, it identifies ctDNA levels as a strong predictor of recurrence.\n*   **Checkpoint inhibitors can be effective in select cases:** Article #3 presents case reports showing that checkpoint inhibitors (pembrolizumab) can induce durable responses in *some* advanced pancreatic cancers, particularly when biomarkers like PD-L1 expression and tumor mutational burden are considered.\n\nConsidering these findings, and the patient's current stable disease for 12 months, the prognosis is more favorable than previously anticipated.

Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nCapecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers. Capecitabine is a prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to fluorouracil (antimetabolite) in the tumor, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor tissue.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal

The effectiveness of radical resection for pancreatic cancer with distant metastases is unknown. Here, we report a case of long term survival treated with conversion surgery following chemotherapy after diagnostic metastasectomy for pancreatic cancer with synchronous liver metastasis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 73-year-old man was referred to our hospital to examine and treat for cancer of the pancreatic body. Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 26-mm hypovascular tumor in contact with the common hepatic artery (CHA) (> 180 degrees ), the celiac artery (< 180 degrees ), and portal vein at the pancreatic body. Resectability was determined as \"borderline resectable.\" Two courses of gemcitabine plus S-1 combination therapy (GS) were administered as neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). CT scan showed tumor shrinkage (21 mm), determined as stable disease (SD) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Although the abdomen was opened for radical resection, a small nodule on the liver was detected and removed. Since the nodule was diagnosed as adenocarcinoma by intraoperative frozen section, resection of the primary tumor was not performed. After three subsequent courses of GS therapy, no distant metastases were detected under radiological findings. Distal pancreatectomy with celiac artery resection (DP-CAR) was performed as radical surgery 6 months after the initial diagnosis. Histological diagnosis was well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma, showing ypT1 ypN1 M1 stage IV, negative surgical margin (R0), and grade III in the Evans classification. S-1 was administered every other day from 6 months after resection up to the present. The patient has been alive with no recurrence for 5 years after the initial diagnosis and 4.5 years after the resection. CONCLUSION: There is a case that received survival benefits from conversion surgery following chemotherapy after diagnostic metastasectomy in pancreatic cancer with synchronous liver metastasis.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 29970648\nTitle: Efficacy and safety of computed tomography-guided (125)I brachytherapy for lymph node metastatic from hepatocellular carcinoma.\nAuthors: He C, Liu Y, Li Y\nJournal: Journal of cancer research and therapeutics\nPublication Date: 2018\nAbstract: PURPOSE: A survival benefit may be associated with the positive control of extrahepatic lymph node metastasis (LNM) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, no standard treatment exists. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of iodine-125 ((125)I) brachytherapy (BT) of LNM of HCC, especially in patients with multiple lymph nodules or repeated lymph node recurrence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From June 2007 to July 2016, clinical and imaging data of 22 patients were collected at our center. According to the treatment planning system, 37 BT targets were treated by seed implantation with computed tomography (CT)-guidance. The radioactive treatment-related adverse events and surgical complications were recorded. The BT target therapeutic response was evaluated by the RECIST. The median survival time and rates were evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were enrolled (median age: 48 years; 90.9% males), and 58 lymph node areas were diagnosed as metastatic. The incidence of LNM was high in porta hepatis (33.9%) and right para-aortic nodes (14.2%), and lower incidence rates were observed in other areas. The median imaging follow-up time was 12 months (inter-quartile range 5.5-20.5), the complete response was 29, the partial response was 5, the stable disease was 2, the progressive disease was 1, and the local response rate was 91.8%. The median survival time from the beginning of BT was 25 months. The 1, 2, and 3-year overall survival rates were 64.3%, 43.4%, and 27.1%, respectively, and the 5-year overall survival rate from the time of HCC diagnosis was 31.1%. No BT-induced acute morbidity according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria was reported. After 5.5 months, one patient diagnosed with a duodenal ulcer underwent gastroduodenoscopy. The surgical complications included mild pancreatitis in 3 patients and stomach bleeding and pneumothorax in 1 patient. CONCLUSION: CT-guided (125)I BT treatment of LNM of HCC presented good local control rates and controllable complications. It is a safe and effective palliative treatment for patients with LNM of HCC. Further study is needed to evaluate its long-term safety and efficacy.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
