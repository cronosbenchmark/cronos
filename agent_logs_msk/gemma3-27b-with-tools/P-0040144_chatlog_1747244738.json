METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients who were treated at our hospital for lung adenocarcinoma from 2004/01 to 2014/03. The patients were divided into groups of those with lung adenocarcinoma alone and those with lung and breast cancer. Kaplan-Meier plots and log-rank tests were used to estimate outcomes. RESULTS: 54 patients with lung adenocarcinoma and breast cancer were compared with 457 patients with single primary lung adenocarcinomas. After propensity score matching with control of age, operation type, smoking status and pathologic stage, tumor differentiation, recurrence rate and tumor size were significantly different between two groups. The significant predictors for recurrence included undergone chemotherapy (HR = 25, p < 0.001), moderate/poor differentiation (HR = 8.125, p = 0.012), tumor size >== 2 cm (HR = 15, p < 0.001), LVSI (HR = 13.67, p = 0.031) and GGO ratio < 50% (HR = 14.667, p = 0.014). The significant prognostic factors for survival were accepted chemotherapy (HR = 6.182, p = 0.021), LVSI (HR = 22, p = 0.012) and GGO ratio < 50% (HR = 9.143, p = 0.045). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with lung adenocarcinoma and breast cancer had a better 5-year disease-free survival (p = 0.009), while the Her2-negative patients obtained a better overall survival (p = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with breast cancer and lung adenocarcinoma, independent risk factors of recurrence were undergone chemotherapy, moderate/poor differentiation, tumor size >== 2 cm, LVSI and GGO ratio < 50%. Only undergone chemotherapy, LVSI and GGO ratio < 50% were significant poor predictors for survival. However, patients with metachronous lung adenocarcinoma and breast cancer had better disease-free survival and less tumor recurrence than patients with lung adenocarcinoma alone.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 38387107\nTitle: Who benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in stage I lung adenocarcinoma? A multi-dimensional model for candidate selection.\nAuthors: Jiang MQ, Qian LQ, Shen YJ\nJournal: Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)\nPublication Date: 2024 Apr\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Despite promising overall survival of stage I lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients, 10-25 % of them still went through recurrence after surgery. [1] While it is still disputable whether adjuvant chemotherapy is necessary for stage I patients. [2] IASLC grading system for non-mucinous LUAD shows that minor high-grade patterns are significant indicator of poor prognosis. [3] Other risk factors, such as, pleura invasion, lympho-vascular invasion, STAS, etc. are also related to poor prognosis. [4-6] There still lack evidence whether IASLC grade itself or together with other risk factors can guide the use of adjuvant therapy in stage I patients. In this article, we tried to establish a multi-variable recurrence prediction model for stage I LUAD patients that is able to identify candidates of adjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS: We retrospectively collected patients who underwent lung surgery from 2018.8.1 to 2018.12.31 at our institution and diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma pT1-2aN0M0 (stage I). Clinical data, manifestation on CT scan, pathologic features, driver gene mutations and follow-up information were collected. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed utilizing the non-adjuvant cohort to predict disease free survival (DFS) and a nomogram was constructed and applied to the total cohort. Kaplan-Meier method was used to compare DFS between groups. Statistical analysis was conducted by R version 3.6.3. FINDINGS: A total of 913 stage I LUAD patients were included in this study. Median follow-up time is 48.1 months.4-year and 5-year DFS are 92.9 % and 89.6 % for the total cohort. 65 patient experienced recurrence or death. 4-year DFS are 97.0 %,94.6 % and 76.2 %, and 5-year DFS are 95.5 %, 90.0 % and 74.1 % in IASLC Grade1, 2 and 3, respectively(p < 0.0001). High-risk patients defined by single risk factors, such as, IASLC grade 3, pleura invasion, STAS, less LN resected could not benefit from adjuvant therapy. A LASSO-COX regression model was built and patients are divided into high-risk and low-risk groups. In the high-risk group, patients underwent adjuvant chemotherapy have longer DFS than those who did not (p = 0.024), while in the low-risk group, patients underwent adjuvant chemotherapy have inferior DFS than those who did not (p < 0.001). INTERPRETATION: IASLC grading is a significant indicator of DFS, however it could not guide adjuvant therapy in our stage I LUAD cohort. Growth patterns and T indicators together with other risk factors could identify high-risk patients that are potential candidate of adjuvant therapy, including some stage IA LUAD patients.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 36104006\nTitle: Adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with recurrence after completely resected stage IB lung adenocarcinoma: Propensity-matched analysis in a cohort of 147 recurrences.\nAuthors: Xu F, Chen HC, Xu H\nJournal: Thoracic cancer\nPublication Date: 2022 Nov\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) is considered for high-risk patients in stage IB lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). However, these risk factors are recognized as negative prognostic factors, not as predictors of ACT efficacy. This study aimed to analyze the efficacy of ACT in stage IB patients by retrospectively examining patients who had recurrence. METHODS: We reviewed 1399 patients with stage IB (American Joint Committee on Cancer 7th edition) LUAD from 2012 to 2017 in our institution and found 147 patients with recurrence. The last follow-up date was December 30, 2021. One-to-one propensity-score matching (PSM) was used to reduce the potential selection bias. RESULTS: Fifty-five (37.4%) patients had received ACT and 92 (62.6%) had not (non-ACT). Patients with ACT were younger (p < 0.001), had larger tumors (p < 0.001) and more lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.02), and seemed to have less distant recurrence (p = 0.001). After PSM, 110 patients were matched and baseline characteristics were balanced. ACT was not associated with improved disease-free survival (DFS) after matching (mDFS = 23.5 m for ACT vs. 29.5 m for non-ACT, p = 0.13). ACT failed to prolong DFS of patients in the extracranial recurrence subgroup and EGFR mutation subgroups, and was even associated with shorter DFS in intracranial relapsed patients (mDFS = 30.3 m vs. 33.5 m, p = 0.083) and patients with tumor </=30 mm (mDFS = 21.9 m vs. 30.8 m, p = 0.076). CONCLUSION: In patients who were destined to develop recurrence after completely resected stage IB LUAD, ACT might not be associated with improved DFS. Further large multicenter studies are warranted to validate these findings.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Here's how this information impacts my assessment:\n\nThe articles highlight several key points:\n\n*   **Article #1:** Suggests that undergoing chemotherapy *is* a risk factor for recurrence in lung adenocarcinoma, particularly in patients with other adverse features like poor differentiation, larger tumor size, and lymphovascular invasion. This seems counterintuitive, but the study suggests chemotherapy may be associated with a higher recurrence rate in a specific population.\n*   **Article #2:** Focuses on identifying patients who *would* benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in Stage I LUAD. It emphasizes that IASLC grading alone isn't sufficient and a multi-dimensional model is needed. It suggests that adjuvant chemotherapy may be beneficial for *high-risk* patients identified by this model, but detrimental to low-risk patients.\n*   **Article #3:** Specifically examines patients who *recurred* after complete resection of Stage IB LUAD. It found that adjuvant chemotherapy did *not* improve disease-free survival in this group, and may even be detrimental in certain subgroups (intracranial relapse, smaller tumors).\n\nConsidering the patient's history \u2013 progression observed on CT scan at age 68.052, and the indeterminate finding at age 69.310 \u2013 and the findings from these articles, the risk of recurrence remains significant. The fact that the patient *already* received chemotherapy (pemetrexed and carboplatin) is a point of concern, given Article #1's finding that chemotherapy can be a risk factor for recurrence. Article #3 also suggests that in patients who recur despite initial treatment, further chemotherapy may not be beneficial.\n\nTherefore, despite the MSS status and relatively low TMB, the documented progression and prior chemotherapy treatment lead me to believe the likelihood of recurrence within the next 12 months is high.\n\n[ANSWER: A]"

METHODS: The subjects of this study were 199 never smokers with advanced lung adenocarcinoma, who were enrolled in a prospective randomized phase III study (First-SIGNAL) comparing gefitinib with gemcitabine plus cisplatin as first-line therapy. The values of NLR were assessed at two time points: at baseline (pretreatment) and on day 1 of the second cycle (posttreatment). RESULTS: A higher posttreatment NLR was associated with a worse tumor response (median posttreatment NLR, 1.56 for partial response, 1.64 for stable disease, and 2.70 for progressive disease; P < 0.001). The risk of progression was higher when the posttreatment NLR was higher [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.23, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.15-1.31; P < 0.001]. A high posttreatment NLR was associated with an increased risk of death (HR = 1.13, 95 % CI 1.06-1.21; P < 0.001). These associations did not differ according to treatment arms. When total patients were divided into four groups according to the cutoff points of pre- and posttreatment NLRs, those with a high pretreatment NLR that declined substantially after treatment showed improved survival compared with those with a high pretreatment NLR that remained high even after treatment (median overall survival, 22.0 and 15.8 months, respectively; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A high posttreatment NLR is associated with poor prognosis. An early reduction in the NLR after effective treatment may indicate survival improvement in the patients with poor prognosis.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 40012069\nTitle: Spread through air spaces may predict early progression after salvage surgery for EGFR-mutant advanced lung adenocarcinoma treated with targeted therapy.\nAuthors: Liu YW, Lai WA, Hung JY\nJournal: World journal of surgical oncology\nPublication Date: 2025 Feb 26\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE: Salvage resection for residual lung cancer harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations following EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment is gaining traction for its survival benefits. However, the impact of pathological factors on survival remains unclear. METHODS: Between 2013 and 2023, we retrospectively reviewed 34 patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma who received EGFR-TKI therapy. After a median TKI treatment duration of 9.1 months, all patients demonstrated either partial response (n = 27) or stable disease (n = 7) before salvage surgery. Demographic, pathological outcomes, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 34 patients, six (17.6%) achieved a pathological complete response (pCR) and nine (26.5%) had a major pathological response (MPR). Additionally, 11 patients (32.4%) exhibited spread through air spaces (STAS), and lymphovascular invasion (LVI) was observed in nine patients (26.5%). The 3-year PFS and OS rates were 55.8% and 60.5%, respectively. No significant differences in PFS or OS were observed regarding mutation type, TKI generation, pCR, MPR, or LVI. However, Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that STAS was associated with shorter PFS compared to non-STAS cases (p = 0.01). In multivariate analysis, STAS was identified as an independent prognostic factor for PFS (hazard ratio: 2.83, 95% CI: 1.35-28.54, p = 0.02). No significant prognosticators were found for OS in univariate or multivariate analyses. CONCLUSION: While salvage surgery following TKI treatment is feasible and prolongs survival by removing residual primary tumor with potential TKI resistance, STAS may contribute to a higher risk of early progression. This finding warrants further investigation and tailored treatment strategies.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 35446297\nTitle: Effective treatment in lung adenocarcinoma patient with brain metastases harboring novel CLHC1/RNT4 intergenic region- ALK fusion: A case report.\nAuthors: Xia H, Liang B, Liu G\nJournal: Medicine\nPublication Date: 2022 Apr 8\nAbstract: RATIONALE: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion, an important oncogenic mutation, occurs in 3% to 7% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases, and EML4 is the most common partner gene. With the widespread application of next-generation sequencing (NGS), more gene breakpoint fusions have been discovered and functional fusion transcripts can provide targeted clinical benefits. PATIENT CONCERNS AND DIAGNOSIS: A 40-year-old woman was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma with brain metastases. A novel CLHC1/RNT4 intergenic region, ALK (Exon20-29) (abundance 39.97%), was identified using lung puncture tissue by NGS analysis (Simceredx), and results of immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed ALK fusion. INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES: The patient was administered oral crizotinib (250 mg bid) combined with endostar (30 mg d1-7) for 12 cycles from June 18, 2020. The patient's condition was controlled, and the curative effect was evaluated as stable disease (SD). Unfortunately, brain magnetic resonance images showed multiple nodules in the left cerebellar hemisphere, and chest computed tomography showed no significant changes in the progression of the disease. Subsequently, alectinib (600 mg bid) was administered on April 1, 2021. Brain lesions were significantly reduced and partial remission (PR) was achieved. No significant changes were observed in the lung lesions. LESSONS: ALK fusion is a risk factor for brain metastasis (BM) in patients with advanced non-small NSCLC patients. In our case, a novel CLHC1/RNT4 intergenic region, ALK fusion, was identified for the first time in a lung adenocarcinoma patient with BM, who benefited from crizotinib and endostar sequential alectinib. Our case highlights the advantages of NGS for fusion detection and provides promising treatment options for NSCLC patients with BM harboring ALK fusions.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-derived entropy and histopathology from 128 patients who had undergone curative surgery for lung adenocarcinoma. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed using univariate and multivariate Cox regression models. Independent predictors were used to construct survival prediction models. RESULTS: Entropy significantly correlated with histopathology, including tumor grades, lympho-vascular invasion, and visceral pleural invasion. Furthermore, entropy was an independent predictor of unfavorable DFS (p = 0.031) and OS (p = 0.004), while pathological nodal metastasis independently predicted DFS (p = 0.009). Our entropy-based models outperformed the traditional staging system (c-index = 0.694 versus 0.636, p = 0.010 for DFS; c-index = 0.704 versus 0.630, p = 0.233 for OS). The models provided further survival stratification in subgroups comprising different tumor grades (DFS: HR = 2.065, 1.315, and 1.408 for grade 1-3, p = 0.004, 0.001, and 0.039, respectively; OS: HR = 25.557, 6.484, and 2.570, for grade 1-3, p = 0.006, < 0.001, and = 0.224, respectively). CONCLUSION: The glycolytic heterogeneity portrayed by entropy is associated with aggressive histopathological characteristics. The proposed entropy-based models may provide more sophisticated survival stratification in addition to histopathology and may enable personalized treatment strategies for resectable lung cancer.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 23359170\nTitle: Radiotherapy alone versus radiochemotherapy in patients with stage IIIA adenocarcinoma (ADC) of the lung.\nAuthors: Jeremic B, Milicic B, Milisavljevic S\nJournal: Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico\nPublication Date: 2013 Sep\nAbstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate the outcome of radiotherapy (RT) versus radiochemotherapy (RT-CHT) in patients with locally advanced (stage III) inoperable adenocarcinoma of the lung. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 146 patients with these characteristics were among 600 patients enrolled into five prospective trials and were treated with either hyperfractionated (Hfx) RT (64.8 and 69.6 Gy using 1.2 Gy bid) alone (n = 33) or with Hfx RT (64.8 and 69.6 Gy using 1.2 Gy bid and 67.6 Gy using 1.3 Gy bid) and concurrent carboplatin-etoposide or paclitaxel-carboplatin (n = 113). RESULTS: The median times and 5-year overall survival (OS), local progression-free survival (LPFS) and the distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) rates for all 146 patients were 17, 20 and 20 months, respectively, and 15, 26 and 33, respectively. RT-CHT was superior to RT alone in terms of both OS (MST 19 vs. 12 months, respectively, 5-year OS 18 vs. 6 %, respectively; p = 0.003) and LPFS (MTLP 21 vs. 15 months, respectively, 5-year LPFS 28 vs. 0 %; p = 0.06), but not the DMFS (p = 0.43). In all 146 patients, the most frequent acute high-grade toxicity was esophageal, bronchopulmonary and hematological (each 12 %), while the most frequent late high-grade toxicity was bronchopulmonary (4 %) and esophageal (3 %). RT-CHT caused significantly more frequent acute high-grade (>3) esophageal (15 %), and hematological (15 %), while late high-grade toxicity was similar between RT and RT-CHT groups of patients. CONCLUSION: RT-CHT achieved excellent results (MST 19 months, 5-year survival 18 %) in this patient population accompanied with low toxicity, comparing favorably to results of other similar studies.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 40083024\nTitle: Intratumoral and peritumoral CT radiomics in predicting anaplastic lymphoma kinase mutations and survival in patients with lung adenocarcinoma: a multicenter study.\nAuthors: Chen W, Lin G, Feng Y\nJournal: Cancer imaging : the official publication of the International Cancer Imaging Society\nPublication Date: 2025 Mar 13\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: To explore the value of intratumoral and peritumoral radiomics in preoperative prediction of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutation status and survival in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. METHODS: We retrospectively collected data from 505 eligible patients with lung adenocarcinoma from four hospitals (training and external validation sets 1-3). The CT-based radiomics features were extracted separately from the gross tumor volume (GTV) and GTV incorporating peritumoral 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-, and 15-mm regions (GPTV(3), GPTV(6), GPTV(9), GPTV(12), and GPTV(15)), and screened the most relevant features to construct radiomics models to predict ALK (+). The combined model incorporated radiomics scores (Rad-scores) of the best radiomics model and clinical predictors was constructed. Performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Progression-free survival (PFS) outcomes were examined using the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: In the four sets, 21.19% (107/505) patients were ALK (+). The GPTV(3) radiomics model using a support vector machine algorithm achieved the best predictive performance, with the highest average AUC of 0.811 in the validation sets. Clinical TNM stage and pleural indentation were independent predictors. The combined model incorporating the GPTV(3)-Rad-score and clinical predictors achieved higher performance than the clinical model alone in predicting ALK (+) in three validation sets [AUC: 0.855 (95% CI: 0.766-0.919) vs. 0.648 (95% CI: 0.543-0.745), P = 0.001; 0.882 (95% CI: 0.801-0.962) vs. 0.634 (95% CI: 0.548-0.714), P < 0.001; 0.810 (95% CI: 0.727-0.877) vs. 0.663 (95% CI: 0.570-0.748), P = 0.006]. The prediction score of the combined model could stratify PFS outcomes in patients receiving ALK-TKI therapy (HR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.15-0.89; P = 0.026) and immunotherapy (HR: 2.49; 95% CI: 1.22-5.08; P = 0.012). CONCLUSION: The presented combined model based on GPTV(3) effectively mined tumor features to predict ALK mutation status and stratify PFS outcomes in patients with lung adenocarcinoma.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
