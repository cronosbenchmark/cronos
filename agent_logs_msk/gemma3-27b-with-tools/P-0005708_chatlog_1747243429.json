A global definition of ER is lacking and different cut-off values (6, 8, and 12 months) have been adopted. The aims of this study were to define the optimal cut-off for the definition of ER and predictive factors for ER. METHODS: Recurrence was recorded for all consecutive patients undergoing upfront surgery for PDAC at our institute between 2010 and 2017. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were utilized, to estimate the optimal cut-off for the definition of ER as a predictive factor for poor post-progression survival (PPS). To identify predictive factors of ER, univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used. RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty one cases were retrospectively evaluated. The recurrence rate was 76.9%. ER rates were 29.0%, 37.6%, and 47.6%, when adopting 6, 8, and 12 months as cut-offs, respectively. A significant difference in median PPS was only shown between ER and late recurrence using 12 months as cut-off (p = 0.005). In the multivariate analysis, a pre-operative value of CA 19-9 > 70.5 UI/L (OR 3.10 (1.41-6.81); p = 0.005) and the omission of adjuvant treatment (OR 0.18 (0.08-0.41); p < 0.001) were significant predictive factors of ER. CONCLUSIONS: A twelve-months cut-off should be adopted for the definition of ER. Almost 50% of upfront-resected patients presented ER, and it significantly affected the prognosis. A high preoperative value of CA 19-9 and the omission of adjuvant treatment were the only predictive factors for ER.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 33084211\nTitle: Pattern of local recurrence after curative resection in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma according to the initial location of the tumor.\nAuthors: Kim JR, Kim H, Kwon W\nJournal: Journal of hepato-biliary-pancreatic sciences\nPublication Date: 2021 Jan\nAbstract: BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to identify the types of recurrence in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and discover the frequent location of the local recurrence. METHODS: This study included 361 patients with PDAC who underwent curative-intent surgery between 2007-2014. RESULTS: Among 361 patients, 75.1% (n = 271) developed recurrence during the follow-up period. The 5-year overall survival rate of recurred patients was 8.3%. The patterns of recurrence were classified as local (17.7%), systemic (62.0%), and loco-systemic (20.3%). According to the preoperative tumor locations, patients with uncinate and head cancer showed higher rates of local recurrence than those with body and tail cancer (47.8% vs 17.2%, P < .001). When comparing uncinate and head cancer only, patients with uncinate cancer had much more frequent local recurrence around the superior mesenteric artery/vein (M zone) than around the hepatoduodenal ligament/common hepatic artery (H zone). Patients with head cancer had a higher rate of local recurrence in the H zone (H zone vs M zone; 53.5% vs 81.4% in uncinate cancer, P = .001; 66.7% vs 44.4% in head cancer, P = .056). CONCLUSION: Discovering the patterns of recurrence and frequent locations of recurrence may assist in local control as well as in the development of a customized individual approach for each patient.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 31454073\nTitle: Meta-analysis of recurrence pattern after resection for pancreatic cancer.\nAuthors: Tanaka M, Mihaljevic AL, Probst P\nJournal: The British journal of surgery\nPublication Date: 2019 Nov\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Initial recurrence mapping of resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) could help in stratifying patient subpopulations for optimal postoperative follow-up. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the initial recurrence patterns of PDAC and to correlate them with clinicopathological factors. METHODS: MEDLINE and Web of Science databases were searched systematically for studies reporting first recurrence patterns after PDAC resection. Data were extracted from the studies selected for inclusion. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95 per cent confidence intervals were calculated to determine the clinicopathological factors related to the recurrence sites. The weighted average of median overall survival was calculated. RESULTS: Eighty-nine studies with 17 313 patients undergoing PDAC resection were included. The weighted median rates of initial recurrence were 20.8 per cent for locoregional sites, 26.5 per cent for liver, 11.4 per cent for lung and 13.5 per cent for peritoneal dissemination. The weighted median overall survival times were 19.8 months for locoregional recurrence, 15.0 months for liver recurrence, 30.4 months for lung recurrence and 14.1 months for peritoneal dissemination. Meta-analysis revealed that R1 (direct) resection (OR 2.21, 95 per cent c.i. 1.12 to 4.35), perineural invasion (OR 5.19, 2.79 to 9.64) and positive peritoneal lavage cytology (OR 5.29, 3.03 to 9.25) were significantly associated with peritoneal dissemination as initial recurrence site. Low grade of tumour differentiation was significantly associated with liver recurrence (OR 4.15, 1.71 to 10.07). CONCLUSION: Risk factors for recurrence patterns after surgery could be considered for specific surveillance and treatments for patients with pancreatic cancer.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

However, I can offer a qualified assessment.\n\nThe PubMed articles consistently show a high recurrence rate for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Article #1 indicates a 76.9% recurrence rate overall, with nearly 50% experiencing early recurrence (within 12 months) based on a 12-month cut-off. Articles #2 and #3 reinforce the high recurrence rates and highlight different patterns of recurrence (local, systemic, locoregional, liver, lung, peritoneal).\n\nWithout knowing the specifics from the `timeline0.txt` file (stage, grade, margins, treatment received), I can only rely on general probabilities. The articles suggest that factors like CA 19-9 levels, adjuvant treatment, resection margins (R1 resection), perineural invasion, and peritoneal cytology all influence recurrence patterns and timing.\n\nGiven the aggressive nature of pancreatic cancer and the high recurrence rates, it is *more likely* that recurrence will occur within the next 12 months.
