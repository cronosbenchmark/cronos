chemotherapy drug in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

They underwent surgery at 60.591 and then received chemotherapy with oxaliplatin, leucovorin, irinotecan, and fluorouracil between ages 60.739 and 61.183. CT and MR scans performed between ages 60.556 and 61.523 consistently showed \"no progression\" or were \"indeterminate.\" CA 19-9 levels initially decreased after diagnosis but then increased to 121 at age 61.293 before decreasing again to 52 at age 61.523. CEA levels remained relatively stable, ranging from 2.3 to 3.6.\n\nThe patient's scans consistently show no evidence of progression, and the CA 19-9 levels, while fluctuating, do not indicate definitive recurrence at the last measurement. The fact that the patient completed chemotherapy and has had multiple negative scans is reassuring. However, pancreatic cancer has a high recurrence rate, and CA 19-9 can be a useful tumor marker.\n\nGiven the limited timeframe of follow-up (approximately 6 months post-treatment) and the fluctuating CA 19-9 levels, it's difficult to definitively rule out recurrence. However, based on the available data, the risk of recurrence within the next 12 months appears to be relatively low.\n\n[ANSWER: B]"

The aim of this study was to identify factors related to receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy and its impact on recurrence and survival. METHODS: This was a multicentre retrospective study of patients undergoing pancreatic resection for adenocarcinoma arising from intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia between January 2010 and December 2020 at 18 centres. Recurrence and survival outcomes for patients who did and did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy were compared using propensity score matching. RESULTS: Of 459 patients who underwent pancreatic resection, 275 (59.9%) received adjuvant chemotherapy (gemcitabine 51.3%, gemcitabine-capecitabine 21.8%, FOLFIRINOX 8.0%, other 18.9%). Median follow-up was 78 months. The overall recurrence rate was 45.5% and the median time to recurrence was 33 months. In univariable analysis in the matched cohort, adjuvant chemotherapy was not associated with reduced overall (P = 0.713), locoregional (P = 0.283) or systemic (P = 0.592) recurrence, disease-free survival (P = 0.284) or overall survival (P = 0.455). Adjuvant chemotherapy was not associated with reduced site-specific recurrence. In multivariable analysis, there was no association between adjuvant chemotherapy and overall recurrence (HR 0.89, 95% c.i. 0.57 to 1.40), disease-free survival (HR 0.86, 0.59 to 1.30) or overall survival (HR 0.77, 0.50 to 1.20). Adjuvant chemotherapy was not associated with reduced recurrence in any high-risk subgroup (for example, lymph node-positive, higher AJCC stage, poor differentiation). No particular chemotherapy regimen resulted in superior outcomes. CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy following resection of adenocarcinoma arising from intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia does not appear to influence recurrence rates, recurrence patterns or survival.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 39191599\nTitle: Pathologic complete response following neoadjuvant chemotherapy in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: Impact on survival and recurrence.\nAuthors: Tamburrino D, Arcangeli C, De Stefano F\nJournal: Surgery\nPublication Date: 2024 Nov\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant treatment in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is a rare occurrence. Similar to other malignancies, achieving a pathologic complete response in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma seems to correlate with improved survival. However, because of the rarity of such events, the true significance of pathologic complete response in pancreatic cancer remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of pathologic complete response on survival and recurrence. METHODS: In a single-center retrospective study, pathologic complete response was defined as no evidence of viable tumor cells in resected specimen entirely sampled according to a rigorous protocol and in which a residual tumor bed was identified. Disease-specific survival and disease-free survival were measured from surgery. Independent predictors for disease-specific survival and disease-free survival were examined. RESULTS: Overall, 403 patients were included. Pathologic complete response was found in 15 patients (3.8%), after chemotherapy alone. After a median follow-up of 42 months (95% CI 38-45), 3-year disease-specific survival was 87% in pathologic complete response patients vs 43% in those without pathologic complete response (P = .014). The recurrence rate was 40% (n = 6/15) in the pathologic complete response group compared with 69.8% (n = 271/388) in those without pathologic complete response. Disease-free survival was longer in the pathologic complete response group, with higher 1- and 3-year rates compared with the no-pathologic complete response group (80% vs 60% and 48% vs 24%, respectively). Pathologic complete response was found to be an independent protective factor for disease-specific survival (P = .035) but not for disease-free survival (P = .052). CONCLUSION: Pathologic complete response in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is not synonymous of cure but ensure a prolonged survival. Nevertheless, recurrence remains a significant concern, with high rates observed even among these exceptional responders.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 33086310\nTitle: Prospective Phase II Trials Validate the Effect of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy on Pattern of Recurrence in Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Chawla A, Qadan M, Castillo CF\nJournal: Annals of surgery\nPublication Date: 2022 Nov 1\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to characterize the patterns of first recurrence after curative-intent resection for pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: We evaluated the first site of recurrence after neoadjuvant treatment as locoregional (LR) or distant metastasis (DM). To validate our findings, we evaluated the pattern from 2 phase II clinical trials evaluating neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in PDAC. METHODS: We identified site of first recurrence from a retrospective cohort of patients from 2011 to 2017 treated with NAC followed by chemoradiation and then an operation or an operation first followed by adjuvant therapy, and 2 separate prospective cohorts of patients derived from 2 phase II clinical trials evaluating patients treated with NAC in borderline-resectable and locally advanced PDAC. RESULTS: In the retrospective cohorts, 160 out of 285 patients (56.1%) recurred after a median disease-free survival (mDFS) of 17.2 months. The pattern of recurrence was DM in 81.9% of patients, versus LR in 11.1%. This pattern was consistent in patients treated with upfront resection and adjuvant chemotherapy (DM 83.0%, LR 16.9%) regardless of margin-involvement (DM 80.1%, LR 19.4%). The use of NAC did not alter pattern of recurrence; 81.7% had DM and 18.3% had LR. This pattern also remained consistent regardless of margin-involvement (DM 94.1%, LR 5.9%). In the Phase II borderline-resectable trial (NCI# 01591733) cohort of 32 patients, the mDFS was 34.2 months. Pattern of recurrence remained predominantly DM (88.9%) versus LR (11.1%). In the Phase II locally-advanced trial (NCI# 01821729) cohort of 34 patients, the mDFS was 30.7 months. Although there was a higher rate of local recurrence in this cohort, pattern of first recurrence remained predominantly DM (66.6%) versus LR (33.3%) and remained consistent independent of margin-status. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of recurrence in PDAC is predominantly DM rather than LR, and is consistent regardless of the use of NAC and margin involvement.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

        "content": "Okay, considering the PubMed search results and the patient's clinical data, here's my assessment of the likelihood of cancer progression in the next 12 months:\n\nThe PubMed articles highlight a few key points:\n\n*   **Recurrence is common:** Pancreatic adenocarcinoma has a high recurrence rate, even after seemingly successful treatment.\n*   **Distant Metastasis is Predominant:** The majority of recurrences are distant metastases rather than local/regional recurrence. This is consistent across multiple studies, even with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\n*   **Pathologic Complete Response is Rare but Beneficial:** Achieving a pathologic complete response (pCR) significantly improves survival, but recurrence still occurs in a substantial portion of these patients.\n*   **Chemotherapy Impact on Recurrence:** The impact of adjuvant chemotherapy on recurrence rates is debated, with some studies showing no significant benefit in specific populations (like those with adenocarcinoma arising from IPMN).\n\nNow, applying this to the patient:\n\nThe patient completed chemotherapy (oxaliplatin, leucovorin, irinotecan, and fluorouracil) and has had multiple imaging scans showing no progression. However, the CA 19-9 levels have fluctuated, increasing to 121 at 61.293 and then decreasing to 52 at 61.523. While the most recent CA 19-9 is lower, the increase is concerning. Given the high risk of distant metastasis and the fluctuating tumor marker, the possibility of progression within the next 12 months cannot be ruled out.\n\nAlthough the scans have been negative so far, pancreatic cancer is known for its aggressive nature and tendency to recur, often with distant spread.\n\n[ANSWER: A]"

Therefore, the aim of this study was to approach complete follow-up and to analyse survival and prognostic factors of patients who underwent surgical treatment for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Between 1992 and 2002, 343 patients underwent surgical treatment for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. One hundred and sixty patients underwent a resection with a curative intention and 183 patients underwent bypass surgery for palliation. Follow-up was complete for 93% of patients. Median survival after resection and bypass was 17.0 and 7.5 months, and 5-year survival was 8% and 0, respectively. In multivariate analysis, tumour-positive lymph nodes, non-radical surgery, poor tumour differentiation, and tumour size were independent prognostic factors for survival after resection. For patients treated with bypass surgery, metastatic disease and tumour size independently predicted survival. In conclusion, actual survival of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma is disappointing compared with the actuarial survival rates reported in the literature. The independent prognostic factors for survival of patients who underwent surgical treatment for pancreatic adenocarcinoma are tumour-related.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 23498362\nTitle: Follow-up after curative surgery for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: asymptomatic recurrence is associated with improved survival.\nAuthors: Nordby T, Hugenschmidt H, Fagerland MW\nJournal: European journal of surgical oncology : the journal of the European Society of Surgical Oncology and the British Association of Surgical Oncology\nPublication Date: 2013 Jun\nAbstract: AIM: There is no consensus on the optimal follow-up schedule of patients after surgery for pancreatic cancer. In this retrospective study, recurrence and survival were investigated for patients presenting with either symptomatic or asymptomatic recurrence. Patient, tumor and treatment characteristics that predicted the length of postrecurrence survival were identified. METHODS: Clinical records of 164 patients who underwent a pancreatic resection (R0/R1) for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma from January 2000 to December 2010 were retrieved. Patients underwent a systematic follow-up program. Patient, tumor and treatment characteristics were compared between patients with asymptomatic and symptomatic recurrence. RESULTS: Of 164 consecutive patients, 144 patients (88%) had recurrence (29 asymptomatic, 115 symptomatic). The most frequent reported symptoms were abdominal pain, fatigue/weakness, back pain, weight loss, nausea/loss of appetite and jaundice. Median time to recurrence was 12.0 months for asymptomatic and 7.0 months for symptomatic patients (P = 0.036). Median postrecurrence survival was 10.0 months for asymptomatic and 4.0 months for symptomatic patients (P < 0.0001). Median overall survival was 24.5 months for asymptomatic and 11.0 months for symptomatic patients (P < 0.0001). Symptomatic recurrence, disease free survival <12 months, and no adjuvant chemotherapy were the only independent predictors of poor postrecurrence survival. 72% of asymptomatic and 37% of symptomatic patients received oncological treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with asymptomatic pancreatic cancer recurrence have improved recurrence-free, postrecurrence and overall survival. Symptoms when recurrence is diagnosed are a good surrogate marker of biological aggressiveness. Detection of asymptomatic recurrence may facilitate patient eligibility for investigational studies or other forms of treatment.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 39191599\nTitle: Pathologic complete response following neoadjuvant chemotherapy in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: Impact on survival and recurrence.\nAuthors: Tamburrino D, Arcangeli C, De Stefano F\nJournal: Surgery\nPublication Date: 2024 Nov\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant treatment in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is a rare occurrence. Similar to other malignancies, achieving a pathologic complete response in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma seems to correlate with improved survival. However, because of the rarity of such events, the true significance of pathologic complete response in pancreatic cancer remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of pathologic complete response on survival and recurrence. METHODS: In a single-center retrospective study, pathologic complete response was defined as no evidence of viable tumor cells in resected specimen entirely sampled according to a rigorous protocol and in which a residual tumor bed was identified. Disease-specific survival and disease-free survival were measured from surgery. Independent predictors for disease-specific survival and disease-free survival were examined. RESULTS: Overall, 403 patients were included. Pathologic complete response was found in 15 patients (3.8%), after chemotherapy alone. After a median follow-up of 42 months (95% CI 38-45), 3-year disease-specific survival was 87% in pathologic complete response patients vs 43% in those without pathologic complete response (P = .014). The recurrence rate was 40% (n = 6/15) in the pathologic complete response group compared with 69.8% (n = 271/388) in those without pathologic complete response. Disease-free survival was longer in the pathologic complete response group, with higher 1- and 3-year rates compared with the no-pathologic complete response group (80% vs 60% and 48% vs 24%, respectively). Pathologic complete response was found to be an independent protective factor for disease-specific survival (P = .035) but not for disease-free survival (P = .052). CONCLUSION: Pathologic complete response in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is not synonymous of cure but ensure a prolonged survival. Nevertheless, recurrence remains a significant concern, with high rates observed even among these exceptional responders.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

chemotherapy drug in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: timeline1.txt] included in your context\nAGE: 61.813, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 61.813, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 61.813, diagnosis > progression --> PROGRESSION: N, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, \nAGE: 61.813, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 61.813, labtest > ca_19-9_labs --> RESULT: 39, LR_UNIT_MEASURE: Units/ml, \nAGE: 61.813, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 2.6000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 62.049, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 62.049, diagnosis > progression --> PROGRESSION: N, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, \nAGE: 62.049, labtest > ca_19-9_labs --> RESULT: 35, LR_UNIT_MEASURE: Units/ml, \nAGE: 62.049, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 2.6000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 62.282, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 62.282, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 62.282, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 62.282, diagnosis > progression --> PROGRESSION: Indeterminate, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, \nAGE: 62.282, labtest > ca_19-9_labs --> RESULT: 24, LR_UNIT_MEASURE: Units/ml, \nAGE: 62.282, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 2.1000 ng/ml          \n\n[DrugBank: Veal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed 181 PDAC patients who received pancreatectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy, with 67 patients in the training set. An internal validation set of 48 patients and an external validation set of 66 patients were used to validate the result. Comprehensive genomic profiling was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor specimens to determine genomic features using the designed cancer-related gene panel based on next-generation sequencing (NGS). RESULTS: Significant differences were identified between the late recurrence (LR) group and early recurrence (ER) group in tumor copy number instability (CNI) levels. Next, the utility of low CNI (the middle and lowest tertile) with regard to predicting LR was confirmed in the training, internal, and external validation sets. Further univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that CNI was an independent predictive and prognostic biomarker, and had higher predictive accuracy for LR than CA19-9 level, pathological stage, tumor size, and age. In addition, CNI combined with lymph node (LN) metastasis status could provide a more accurate model for predicting LR of PDAC. CONCLUSION: We discovered and validated the association between CNI and clinical outcome in 181 patients with resectable PDAC, demonstrating the utility of lower tumor CNI levels as biomarkers of postoperative LR and favorable prognosis. Moreover, the combination of CNI and LN metastasis status elevated the predictive accuracy and illuminated strategies for patient stratification.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 32790012\nTitle: Appraisal of 5-year recurrence-free survival after surgery in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Yoon SJ, Shin SH, Yoon SK\nJournal: Journal of hepato-biliary-pancreatic sciences\nPublication Date: 2021 Mar\nAbstract: BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is regarded as incurable, with a limited survival rate after curative resection. The aim of this study was to explore long-term survival and late recurrence of PDAC after surgery. METHODS: Medical data of 859 patients who underwent resection between 1995 and 2014 were retrospectively examined. The clinicopathological features of the 5-year recurrence-free survivors and the patients with recurrent disease after 5 years were investigated separately. RESULTS: Among the 768 patients who were finally included in this study, elevated CA 19-9, tumor size, poor differentiation, and positive lymph node metastasis were associated with recurrence. In 89 patients with 5-year RFS, age, tumor size, differentiation, and lymph node metastasis were statistically significant predictive factors. Among these patients, disease relapse occurred in 11 patients; age was the only difference compared to those who remained free of recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Most prognosticators failed to predict the risk of recurrence in the 5 years following surgery for PDAC, and recurrence can occur even at time points up to 100 months. Therefore, cure of PDAC cannot be guaranteed by a 5-year recurrence-free interval, and further studies into the inherent nature of PDAC are needed to develop adequate surveillance systems which may lead to improvements in survival.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 36999776\nTitle: Early and late recurrence patterns of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma after pancreaticoduodenectomy: a multicenter study.\nAuthors: Zhang XP, Xu S, Gao YX\nJournal: International journal of surgery (London, England)\nPublication Date: 2023 Apr 1\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Survival after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains poor because of high incidences of recurrence. The risk factors, patterns, and long-term prognosis in patients with early recurrence and late recurrence (ER and LR) for PDAC after PD were studied. METHODS: Data from patients who underwent PD for PDAC were analyzed. Recurrence was divided into ER (ER </=1 years) and LR (LR >1 years) using the time to recurrence after surgery. Characteristics and patterns of initial recurrence, and postrecurrence survival (PRS) were compared between patients with ER and LR. RESULTS: Among the 634 patients, 281 (44.3%) and 249 (39.3%) patients developed ER and LR, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, preoperative CA19-9 levels, resection margin status, and tumor differentiation were significantly associated with both ER and LR, while lymph node metastasis and perineal invasion were associated with LR. Patients with ER, when compared with patients with LR, showed a significantly higher proportion of liver-only recurrence ( P <0.05), and worse median PRS (5.2 vs. 9.3 months, P <0.001). Lung-only recurrence had a significantly longer PRS when compared with liver-only recurrence ( P <0.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that ER and irregular postoperative recurrence surveillance were independently associated with a worse prognosis ( P <0.001). CONCLUSION: The risk factors for ER and LR after PD are different for PDAC patients. Patients who developed ER had worse PRS than those who developed LR. Patients with lung-only recurrence had a significantly better prognosis than those with other recurrent sites.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
