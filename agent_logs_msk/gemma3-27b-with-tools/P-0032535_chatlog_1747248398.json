Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0032535-T01-IM6\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0032535\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Pancreatic Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Pancreas\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT468\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 648, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 20.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"PAAD\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

While most patients relapse with distant metastases, approximately 30% of patients show isolated local recurrence without evidence of distant metastases. OBJECTIVE: The present analysis investigates the efficacy of chemoradiotherapy in this particular patient group. DESIGN: Retrospective study. PATIENTS: Eighteen consecutive pancreatic cancer patients presenting with isolated locoregional recurrence after surgical resection. The median interval between primary surgery and diagnosis of local recurrence was 10.4 months (range: 2.0-19.3 months). INTERVENTIONS: Patients received 3-D conformal radiation with 45 Gy in 25 fractions of 1.8 Gy/day. Simultaneous chemotherapy was employed either with continuous 5-FU infusion, partly in combination with gemcitabine, or with gemcitabine and cisplatin. Sequential chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin was given to some patients before and after the chemoradiotherapy. RESULTS: In 17 of the 18 patients included, radiotherapy was employed at the intended dose. While WHO grade 3-4 gastrointestinal toxicity was not reported, hematotoxicity was more pronounced. Grades 3 and 4 leukocytopenia occurred in 4 patients (22.2%) and 1 (5.6%) patient, respectively, and grades 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 4 patients (22.2%) and 1 patient(5.6%), respectively. Six (37.5%) complete remissions, 6 (37.5%) partial remissions, and 4 (25.0%) stable diseases were noted in 16 evaluable patients. Median progression-free survival calculated from the start of the chemoradiotherapy was 14.7 months (range: 8.4-21.0 months) . Seven (28.9%) patients had another local relapse, while 11 (61.1%) patients developed distant metastases. Median overall survival from the start of the chemoradiotherapy was 17.5 months (95% CI: 15.6-19.4 months) and median survival from the initial diagnosis was 27.2 months (95% CI: 23.9-30.6 months). CONCLUSION: The data provide a first indication that chemoradiotherapy is feasible and may be an effective treatment option in those patients who present with local metastasis after primary surgery for pancreatic cancer.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 33981756\nTitle: Recurrence of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma after Complete Histopathological Remission Caused by FOLFIRINOX.\nAuthors: Hohn P, Braumann C, Nopel-Dunnebacke S\nJournal: Visceral medicine\nPublication Date: 2021 Mar\nAbstract: We previously reported 2 cases of pathologic complete response (pCR) of a pancreatic cancer (PC) following neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX treatment. We now complete our report by a follow-up on both patients. Patient 1 achieved a disease-free survival of 12 months after initial resection until she developed a singular hepatic metastasis. Treatment by FOLFIRINOX and complete removal of the metastasis by atypical liver resection after 6 months allowed for another 12 months of disease control. After intra-abdominal tumor recurrence and development of intracerebral metastases, the patient died 34 months after primary diagnosis. Patient 2 developed hepatic tumor recurrence only 3 months after initial resection. However, treatment by FOLFIRINOX led to a stable disease for 27 months after resection and was followed by atypical liver resection of multiple segments. Six months later, another hepatic recurrence was suspected. Via next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the tumor genome, a deleterious mutation in the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) gene, causing a BRCAness, was detected. After initial treatment by FOLFOX, maintenance therapy with the poly-ADP-ribose-polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib was initiated. The patient is now alive for 54 months after initial diagnosis of metastasized pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Tumor recurrence is possible even after pCR of PC and remains challenging. In case of multifocal tumor recurrence, chemotherapy remains the standard treatment. Recently, genetic sequencing allows individualized treatments. In selected cases, highly specialized teams can offer a variety of therapeutic options leading to previously unseen clinical courses.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 29556385\nTitle: Phase I study of third-line palliative chemotherapy with low dose paclitaxel for pancreatic cancer.\nAuthors: Tajima H, Okazaki M, Yamaguchi T\nJournal: Molecular and clinical oncology\nPublication Date: 2018 Apr\nAbstract: The prognosis of patients with unresectable or recurrent pancreatic cancers is very poor. Prior to development of nab-paclitaxel (PTX) plus gemcitabine (GEM) therapy and FOLFIRINOX therapy, there was no recommended third-line chemotherapy after 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and GEM-based regimens. The present study conducted a Phase I clinical trial of weekly low-dose PTX as a third-line palliative chemotherapy for patients with pancreatic cancer. PTX was administered on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each cycle, repeated twice as follows: Level 1, 40 mg/m(2) (n=6); Level 2, 50 mg/m(2) (n=4). During the two cycles, three patients developed Grade 3 neutropenia in level 2; thus, the recommended dose was defined as 40 mg/m(2). The disease control rate was 40.0% (stable disease, n=4). Median time to treatment failure of the four patients with stable disease was 5.5 months. In conclusion, palliative chemotherapy with low-dose PTX after failure of GEM and 5-FU is well tolerated and safe for unresectable or recurrent pancreatic cancer patients.

While the TMB is not extremely high, it's not negligible either. Higher TMB can sometimes correlate with response to immunotherapy, but this is less relevant in pancreatic cancer as it typically doesn't respond well to immunotherapy. The MSI stable status also indicates a lower likelihood of response to immunotherapy.\n\nNow, let's consider the PubMed search results (which were not provided, but I will base my answer on general knowledge given the prompt). Generally, even with a good initial response to chemotherapy, pancreatic cancer has a high rate of recurrence and progression. The time to progression after initial response varies, but it's often within 6-18 months. Given the patient is currently at 62.3 years old and showed a complete response at 62.285, they are within that timeframe where progression is a significant possibility.\n\nWhile the patient's performance status improved, and tumor markers decreased, these are not guarantees of sustained remission. The inherent aggressiveness of pancreatic cancer means that microscopic disease may still be present, leading to eventual progression.\n\n[ANSWER: A]"

Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: timeline1.txt] included in your context\nAGE: 62.506, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 62.506, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 62.506, labtest > ca_19-9_labs --> RESULT: 24, LR_UNIT_MEASURE: Units/ml, \nAGE: 62.506, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 1.5000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 62.734, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 62.734, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 62.734, labtest > ca_19-9_labs --> RESULT: 28, LR_UNIT_MEASURE: Units/ml, \nAGE: 62.734, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 1.6000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 63.043, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 63.043, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 63.043, labtest > ca_19-9_labs --> RESULT: 54, LR_UNIT_MEASURE: Units/ml, \nAGE: 63.043, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 1.6000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 63.117, labtest > ca_19-9_labs --> RESULT: 68, LR_UNIT_MEASURE: Units/ml, \nAGE: 63.117, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 1.6000 ng/ml          \n\n[DrugBank: Veal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0032535-T01-IM6\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0032535\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Pancreatic Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Pancreas\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT468\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 648, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 20.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"PAAD\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

Despite being considered a benign disease, only few studies with limited sample size and short follow-up have been published on type 2 AIP. The aim of this observational study was to evaluate long-term outcomes, such as the risk of relapse, pancreatic insufficiency and cancer in a large type 2 AIP cohort with long follow-up. METHODS: Patients with definitive or probable diagnosis of type 2 AIP by International Consensus Diagnostic Criteria (ICDC) present in our prospectively maintained database since 1995 at 31.12.2021 were identified. All patients were clinically evaluated during the year 2022. Clinical, radiological, serological, and pathological data were evaluated. RESULTS: Eighty-eight out of 420 patients present in the database (21%) were diagnosed with type 2 AIP (mean age 33.5 +/- 13.5 years). According to the ICDC, 21 patients (23.8%) had a definitive and 67 (76.2%) a probable diagnosis of type 2 AIP. The mean follow-up was 9.2 +/- 7.1 years (range 1-27 years). No differences were observed when comparing patients with definitive and probable type 2 AIP diagnosis. Concomitant IBD was reported in 77 patients (87.5%). The probability of disease relapse was lower in patients treated with steroids versus surgery (at 5 years 13% vs. 33%; p = 0.038) but this difference was not statistically significant at multivariable analysis. The risk of endocrine or severe exocrine insufficiency was low (5% and 25%). Four extra-pancreatic malignancies (5%) were diagnosed, none pancreatic. One patient died in a car accident. CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 AIP has benign long-term clinical outcomes. Mortality and cancer rates are low and no specific follow-up is needed after radiological remission.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 20828979\nTitle: Neoadjuvant docetaxel-based chemoradiation for resectable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas: New neoadjuvant regimen was safe and provided an interesting pathologic response.\nAuthors: Turrini O, Ychou M, Moureau-Zabotto L\nJournal: European journal of surgical oncology : the journal of the European Society of Surgical Oncology and the British Association of Surgical Oncology\nPublication Date: 2010 Oct\nAbstract: PURPOSE: To assess the safety and efficacy of a new neoadjuvant chemoradiation (CRT) docetaxel-based regimen in patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head or body. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 34 patients with histologically-confirmed resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma were included in this prospective two-center phase II study. Radiotherapy was delivered at the dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions of 1.8 Gy per fractions, 5 days/week, over 5 weeks. Docetaxel was administered as a 1-h intravenous (IV) infusion repeated every week during 5 weeks. The dose was 30 mg/m(2)/week. All patients were restaged after completion of CRT. RESULTS: Tumor progression was documented in 11 patients (32%), stable disease was documented in 20 patients (59%), and partial remission was documented in 3 patients (9%). 23 patients still with local disease at restaging underwent explorative laparotomy. Of this, 17 patients (50%) had a curative pancreaticoduodenectomy with lymphadenectomy. Morbidity and mortality rates were 29% and 0%, respectively. Three patients (17%) had complete histological responses and 5 patients had minimal residual disease. All resected patients (n = 17) underwent R0 resection. The median and five-year survival times for the resected patients were 32 months and 41%, respectively. Among the resected patients, ten (59%) died as a result of recurrent pancreatic cancer without local tumor bed recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant docetaxel-based chemoradiation is well-tolerated. Resected patients had a prolonged survival time. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings and determine the role of such a neoadjuvant approach.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 39630322\nTitle: A case of simultaneous pancreatoduodenectomy and living donor liver transplantation for biliary cancer complicated with congenital biliary dilatation.\nAuthors: Shimamura T, Watanabe M, Koshizuka Y\nJournal: Surgical case reports\nPublication Date: 2024 Dec 4\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: In patients with pancreaticobiliary maljunction complicated by congenital biliary dilatation, the pancreatic enzyme flows back into the bile, leading to bile duct carcinogenesis. Although the biliary tract resection and reconstruction is well documented to decrease the rate of malignancy, cancer occurrence has been reported in the residual intrahepatic or intrapancreatic bile duct, even after resection. We report a case of multiple biliary tract cancers in the liver complicated by congenital biliary dilatation, whose tumor lesions were resected en bloc without disconnecting the biliary tract by simultaneous pancreatoduodenectomy and living donor liver transplantation. CASE PRESENTATION: A 27-year-old woman presented with epigastric discomfort. Examination indicated multiple biliary tract cancers complicated by congenital biliary dilatation. Computed tomography scan revealed three papillary tumors in the right hepatic duct with increased (18)F-FDG accumulation on positron emission tomography. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound revealed another lesion in the left hepatic duct. Adenocarcinoma cells were detected using bile and choledochal brush cytology. Tumors resection by right lobectomy or trisegmentectomy of the liver and extrahepatic bile duct resection indicated a high risk of postoperative liver failure; the residual liver volumes were calculated only 277 ml or 176 ml, respectively. In addition, tumor recurrence owing to bile leakage during the surgery and carcinogenesis from the remaining bile duct were concerned. Pancreatoduodenectomy was performed without disconnecting the biliary tract, and the tumors were resected en bloc with the whole liver. The left lobe liver graft from the husband was then transplanted. After 5 years of adjuvant treatment with tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil potassium, she remained in remission eight and half years after the surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Given the mechanism and development of cancer in the congenital biliary dilatation, simultaneous pancreatoduodenectomy and liver transplantation may be considered, especially in the case of young patients.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

The initial period (within the first 1-2 years) is the highest risk for recurrence.\n\nGiven the patient's stable scans for over a year, the slight increase in CA 19-9 is less concerning in isolation, and the overall clinical picture suggests a sustained response to treatment, I believe the probability of recurrence in the next 6 months is relatively low.\n\n[ANSWER: B]"

Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: timeline1.txt] included in your context\nAGE: 62.506, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 62.506, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 62.506, labtest > ca_19-9_labs --> RESULT: 24, LR_UNIT_MEASURE: Units/ml, \nAGE: 62.506, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 1.5000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 62.734, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 62.734, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 62.734, labtest > ca_19-9_labs --> RESULT: 28, LR_UNIT_MEASURE: Units/ml, \nAGE: 62.734, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 1.6000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 63.043, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 63.043, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 63.043, labtest > ca_19-9_labs --> RESULT: 54, LR_UNIT_MEASURE: Units/ml, \nAGE: 63.043, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 1.6000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 63.117, labtest > ca_19-9_labs --> RESULT: 68, LR_UNIT_MEASURE: Units/ml, \nAGE: 63.117, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 1.6000 ng/ml          \n\n[DrugBank: Veal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

Gemcitabine: Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analog and a chemotherapeutic agent. It was originally investigated for its antiviral effects, but it is now used as an anticancer therapy for various cancers.[A233135] Gemcitabine is a cytidine analog with two fluorine atoms replacing the hydroxyl on the ribose.[A233145] As a prodrug, gemcitabine is transformed into its active metabolites that work by replacing the building blocks of nucleic acids during DNA elongation, arresting tumour growth and promoting apoptosis of malignant cells.[L32960] The structure, metabolism, and mechanism of action of gemcitabine are similar to [cytarabine], but gemcitabine has a wider spectrum of antitumour activity.[A233140]\r\n\r\nGemcitabine is marketed as Gemzar and it is available as intravenous injection. It is approved by the FDA to treat advanced ovarian cancer in combination with [carboplatin], metastatic breast cancer in combination with [paclitaxel], non-small cell lung cancer in combination with [cisplatin], and pancreatic cancer as monotherapy.[L32950] It is also being investigated in other cancer and tumour types.\nCapecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers. Capecitabine is a prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to fluorouracil (antimetabolite) in the tumor, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor tissue.\nPaclitaxel: Paclitaxel is a chemotherapeutic agent marketed under the brand name Taxol among others. Used as a treatment for various cancers, paclitaxel is a mitotic inhibitor that was first isolated in 1971 from the bark of the Pacific yew tree which contains endophytic fungi that synthesize paclitaxel. It is available as an intravenous solution for injection and the newer formulation contains albumin-bound paclitaxel marketed under the brand name Abraxane.\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: timeline0.txt] included in your context\nAGE: 61.501, samples > clinical_sample --> SAMPLE_ID: P-0032535-T01-IM6, PATIENT_ID: P-0032535, CANCER_TYPE: Pancreatic Cancer, SAMPLE_TYPE: Primary, SAMPLE_CLASS: Tumor, METASTATIC_SITE: Not Applicable, PRIMARY_SITE: Pancreas, CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED: Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma, GENE_PANEL: IMPACT468, SAMPLE_COVERAGE: 648, TUMOR_PURITY: 20.0, ONCOTREE_CODE: PAAD, MSI_COMMENT: MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: timeline1.txt] included in your context\nAGE: 62.506, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 62.506, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 62.506, labtest > ca_19-9_labs --> RESULT: 24, LR_UNIT_MEASURE: Units/ml, \nAGE: 62.506, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 1.5000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 62.734, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 62.734, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 62.734, labtest > ca_19-9_labs --> RESULT: 28, LR_UNIT_MEASURE: Units/ml, \nAGE: 62.734, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 1.6000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 63.043, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 63.043, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 63.043, labtest > ca_19-9_labs --> RESULT: 54, LR_UNIT_MEASURE: Units/ml, \nAGE: 63.043, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 1.6000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 63.117, labtest > ca_19-9_labs --> RESULT: 68, LR_UNIT_MEASURE: Units/ml, \nAGE: 63.117, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 1.6000 ng/ml          \n\n[DrugBank: Veal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0032535-T01-IM6\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0032535\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Pancreatic Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Pancreas\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT468\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 648, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 20.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"PAAD\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

Results of a systematic review with meta-analysis.\nAuthors: Guerra F, Barucca V, Coletta D\nJournal: European journal of surgical oncology : the journal of the European Society of Surgical Oncology and the British Association of Surgical Oncology\nPublication Date: 2020 Oct\nAbstract: There are demonstrations that the prognosis of patients with isolated pulmonary dissemination of pancreatic cancer is more favorable than that of patients with other patterns of disease progression. The aim of this systematic review with meta-analysis was to evaluate the oncological outcomes of pulmonary vs. non-pulmonary metastasis of patients with pancreatic cancer. A total of 11 916 patients with secondary spread of pancreatic cancer were included from 15 primary reports. In the setting of single-organ disease dissemination, the lung demonstrated a significant survival advantage over hepatic, locoregional, or peritoneal localization. In particular, patients who recurred in the lung after pancreatectomy, showed a significant survival benefit as compared to those patients with hepatic and locoregional relapse in terms of disease-free survival, survival after recurrence and overall survival.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 37870253\nTitle: Progression of Site-specific Recurrence of Pancreatic Cancer and Implications for Treatment.\nAuthors: Rompen IF, Levine J, Habib JR\nJournal: Annals of surgery\nPublication Date: 2024 Aug 1\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE: To analyze postrecurrence progression in the context of recurrence sites and assess implications for postrecurrence treatment. BACKGROUND: Most patients with resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) recur within 2 years. Different survival outcomes for location-specific patterns of recurrence are reported, highlighting their prognostic value. However, a lack of understanding of postrecurrence progression and survival remains. METHODS: This retrospective analysis included surgically treated patients with PDAC at NYU Langone Health (2010-2021). Sites of recurrence were identified at the time of diagnosis and further follow-up. Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank test, and Cox regression analyses were applied to assess survival outcomes. RESULTS: Recurrence occurred in 57.3% (196/342) patients with a median time to recurrence of 11.3 months (95% CI: 12.6-16.5). The first site of recurrence was local in 43.9% of patients, liver in 23.5%, peritoneal in 8.7%, lung in 3.6%, whereas 20.4% had multiple sites of recurrence. Progression to secondary sites was observed in 11.7%. Only lung involvement was associated with significantly longer survival after recurrence compared with other sites (16.9 vs 8.49 months, P = 0.003). In local recurrence, 21 (33.3%) patients were alive after 1 year without progression to secondary sites. This was associated with a CA19-9 of <100 U/mL at the time of primary diagnosis ( P = 0.039), nodal negative disease ( P = 0.023), and well-moderate differentiation ( P = 0.042) compared with patients with progression. CONCLUSION: Except for lung recurrence, postrecurrence survival after PDAC resection is associated with poor survival. A subset of patients with local-only recurrence do not quickly succumb to systemic spread. This is associated with markers for favorable tumor biology, making them candidates for potential curative re-resections when feasible.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 38395676\nTitle: Clinical outcomes of second-line therapy following disease progression on first-line modified FOLFIRINOX for borderline resectable and locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Yoon H, Shin Y, Ryoo BY\nJournal: Pancreatology : official journal of the International Association of Pancreatology (IAP) ... [et al.]\nPublication Date: 2024 May\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Modified FOLFIRINOX (mFOLFIRINOX) is one of the standard first-line therapies in borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (BRPC) and locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer (LAPC). However, there is no globally accepted second-line therapy following progression on mFOLFIRINOX. METHODS: Patients with BRPC and LAPC (n = 647) treated with first-line mFOLFIRINOX between January 2017 and December 2020 were included in this retrospective analysis. The details of the treatment outcomes and patterns of subsequent therapy after mFOLFIRINOX were reviewed. RESULTS: With a median follow-up duration of 44.2 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 42.3-47.6), 322 patients exhibited disease progression on mFOLFIRINOX-locoregional progression only in 177 patients (55.0%) and distant metastasis in 145 patients (45.0%). The locoregional progression group demonstrated significantly longer post-progression survival (PPS) than that of the distant metastasis group (10.1 vs. 7.3 months, p = 0.002). In the locoregional progression group, survival outcomes did not differ between second-line chemoradiation/radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy (progression-free survival with second-line therapy [PFS-2], 3.2 vs. 4.3 months; p = 0.649; PPS, 10.7 vs. 10.2 months; p = 0.791). In patients who received second-line systemic chemotherapy following progression on mFOLFIRINOX (n = 211), gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel was associated with better disease control rates (69.2% vs. 42.3%, p = 0.005) and PFS-2 (3.8 vs. 1.7 months, p = 0.035) than gemcitabine monotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: The current study showed the real-world practice pattern of subsequent therapy and clinical outcomes following progression on first-line mFOLFIRINOX in BRPC and LAPC. Further investigation is necessary to establish the optimal therapy after failure of mFOLFIRINOX.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

        "content": "The PubMed search results confirm the generally poor prognosis following disease progression in pancreatic cancer. Here's a summary of the key findings:\n\n*   **Limited Survival:** Overall survival after progression is limited, typically measured in months. (Articles #2 & #3)\n*   **Site of Progression Matters:** Lung-only recurrence is associated with better survival than other sites, such as the liver or peritoneum. (Articles #1 & #2)\n*   **Locoregional vs. Distant Metastasis:** Locoregional progression (without distant spread) is associated with longer post-progression survival than distant metastasis. (Articles #2 & #3)\n*   **Second-Line Therapy:** The optimal second-line therapy after progression on first-line treatment (like mFOLFIRINOX) is still being investigated. Gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel may be more effective than gemcitabine alone. (Article #3)\n\nGiven the patient's widespread disease (involving lymph nodes and the liver, as indicated in the timeline data), and the fact that they have already progressed despite treatment, the prognosis remains extremely poor. While specific survival times vary, the median survival after progression is typically less than a year.\n\nTherefore, despite any potential treatments, the likelihood of the patient being alive in 12 months is very low.\n\n[ANSWER: B]"
