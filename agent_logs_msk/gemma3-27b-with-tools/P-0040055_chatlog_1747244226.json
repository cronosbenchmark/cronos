Here's a breakdown of the patient's case:\n\n*   **Diagnosis:** 62.366 years old, diagnosed with Stage 1-3 Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD), clinically 1A2, pathologically 2B. Regional lymph node involvement.\n*   **MSI Status:** Microsatellite Stable (MSS).\n*   **TMB:** 5.188 mutations/Mb.\n*   **PD-L1:** Positive.\n*   **Treatment:** Received chemotherapy with Cisplatin and Pemetrexed, starting around age 62.613 and stopping around 62.7854.\n*   **Follow-up (age 63.016):** CT scan shows no evidence of progression. ECOG performance status improved to 0.\n\nGiven the information, the patient was diagnosed with early-stage lung adenocarcinoma, received chemotherapy, and currently shows no evidence of progression on imaging. The PD-L1 positivity suggests potential benefit from immunotherapy, although this isn't explicitly stated as being administered. MSS status and relatively low TMB suggest limited benefit from immunotherapy alone.\n\nConsidering the early stage at diagnosis, the treatment received, and the lack of progression at the last scan (age 63.016), the risk of recurrence in the next 12 months (until approximately age 64.016) is relatively low.

While recurrence rates vary depending on stage and specific patient characteristics, generally, the 5-year recurrence rate for Stage I-II lung adenocarcinoma is between 30-50%. Stage III has a higher recurrence rate, closer to 50-70%. Factors like lymph node involvement, tumor size, and histological subtype (adenocarcinoma) influence recurrence risk. Adjuvant chemotherapy, as the patient received, reduces recurrence risk. PD-L1 positivity and MSS status, while important for treatment decisions, don't directly correlate with recurrence rates in the same way as stage and lymph node status.\n\nConsidering the patient's Stage 1-3 diagnosis, regional lymph node involvement, completion of chemotherapy, and recent scan showing no progression, the risk of recurrence within the next 12 months is still relatively low, but not zero.

However, treatment strategies for these histological subtypes have not been established. This study examined the recurrence rates and patterns in patients with these histological subtypes. METHODS: Overall, 238 patients with lung adenocarcinoma who underwent radical resection were included. According to the histological subtypes, the patients were classified into three groups: neither MP nor SP (MP-/SP-), MP (MP+), and SP (SP+). The clinical and pathological characteristics and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were examined in each group. In addition, univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to investigate the recurrence factors. The site of recurrence, PD-L1 expression, and driver mutations were examined in patients with postoperative recurrence. RESULTS: The recurrence rates were significantly higher in the MP+ and SP+ groups (p = 0.01). The RFS was significantly shorter in the MP+ and SP+ groups (p < 0.001) than in the MP-/SP- group, especially in pStage 1A (p = 0.001). The relationship between recurrence and pathologic factors was significant for pleural, lymphatic, and vascular invasion, as well as MP in univariate analysis and only for MP in multivariate analysis. Most recurrences were distant metastases in the MP+ and SP+ groups. PD-L1 was highly expressed in recurrent SP+ cases. CONCLUSIONS: Early-stage lung adenocarcinoma with MP or SP frequently has postoperative recurrence. Prevention of distant metastases is important in these patients to improve prognosis, and aggressive postoperative chemotherapy may be considered.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 34180578\nTitle: Different pathologic types of early stage lung adenocarcinoma have different post-operative recurrence patterns.\nAuthors: Liu X, Sun K, Yang F\nJournal: Thoracic cancer\nPublication Date: 2021 Aug\nAbstract: OBJECTIVES: To accurately describe the pattern, timing and predictors of disease recurrence after curative resection for different types of early-stage lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). METHODS: A total of 1962 patients with early-stage LUAD were included. The presence of micropapillary, solid components or poorly differentiated cancer as a clinical variable was named \"high-grade\" adenocarcinoma (HGADC), while others were classified as \"low-grade\" adenocarcinoma (LGADC). Predictive factors for specific recurrence patterns were assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses using Cox-proportional hazard regression models. Event dynamics, based on the hazard rate, were evaluated. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 36.0 months, 137 (6.98%) of 1962 patients suffered from recurrence. Multivariable Cox analysis revealed that HGADC was an independent predictor for overall recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] 3.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.09-4.52, p < 0.001), local recurrence (HR 2.77, 95% CI 1.38-5.55, p < 0.001), distant metastasis (HR 3.22, 95% CI 2.03-5.11, p < 0.001), chest recurrence (HR 2.80, 95% CI 1.65-4.75, p < 0.001) and brain recurrence (HR 4.11, 95% CI 1.83-9.22, p < 0.001). However, HGADC (HR 1.56, 95% CI 0.63-3.86, p = 0.335 in univariate analysis) was not a risk factor for bone recurrence. The hazard curve of the whole group presented a double-peaked pattern. Different types of LUAD had different hazard curves. HGADC patients exhibited higher hazard rates than LGADC patients during the whole follow-up. In addition, the recurrence hazard curve in HGADC patients showed a typical \"double-peaked\" pattern, while the curve in LGADC patients displayed a smooth curve after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Different postoperative recurrence patterns were seen in HGADC and LGADC. Site-specific recurrence patterns were also different in HGADC and LGADC types.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 37681230\nTitle: Clinicopathologic study of stage I adenosquamous carcinoma of the lung.\nAuthors: Handa Y, Ikeda T, Hanaki H\nJournal: Japanese journal of clinical oncology\nPublication Date: 2023 Dec 7\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE: Adenosquamous carcinoma of the lung is a characteristic tumor that has both adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma components. Adenosquamous carcinoma is reported to have an aggressive clinical course, but its clinicopathological features and prognosis are unclear in the early stage. METHODS: Patients who underwent surgical resection for pathological stage I non-small cell lung cancer between April 2009 and December 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Preoperative and postoperative data, histologic characteristics and outcomes of patients with adenosquamous carcinoma (n = 40) were compared to adenocarcinoma (n = 598) and squamous cell carcinoma (n = 131) patients. Factors affecting prognosis, particularly on recurrence, were assessed via Cox regression analyses. RESULTS: Patients with adenosquamous carcinoma had a worse prognosis than did patients with adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma in terms of 5 year overall (66.7%) and recurrence-free survival rates (44.9%), as well as a significantly higher recurrence rate (13/40 patients, 32.5%). Multivariable Cox regression analysis for recurrence-free survival rates revealed that the histology of adenosquamous carcinoma was an independent factor for recurrence (hazard ratio: 2.473, 95% confidence interval: 1.328-3.367; P = 0.0004). High serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels (hazard ratio: 5.962) and vascular invasion (hazard ratio: 4.899) were identified as risk factors for recurrence, and patients with adenosquamous carcinoma tended to have distant relapses, such as in the brain. CONCLUSIONS: Early-stage adenosquamous carcinoma of the lung is a histological type associated with severe prognosis and postoperative recurrence, often in distant sites, in approximately one-third of cases. High serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels and vascular invasion might be risk factors of recurrence.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

However, serious adverse effects have been reported to be associated with bevacizumab therapy. In this multicenter prospective cohort study of advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients with stable disease after two cycles of platinum-based double agent chemotherapy, we will compare the ORR between the group who continued with their original chemotherapy regimen and the group in which bevacizumab was added to the original regimen. It is expected that there will be an ORR improvement of 20% in patients in the bevacizumab group plus chemotherapy, compared with those in the original chemotherapy group.

The patterns and mechanisms underlying this phenomenon needs to be explored. We present two such patients here. One patient complained of cough and hemoptysis, the other experienced chest tightness. Both were diagnosed as lung adenocarcinoma. They harbored no driver gene alterations and received first-line and adjuvant chemotherapy respectively. After progression several months later, the second biopsy revealed SCC transformation and the gene test still found no gene abnormalities. The diseases stayed stable after treatment of new therapeutic regimens. Then we searched for literature related and found SCC transformation happened at resistance to target therapy or immunotherapy or spontaneously. Our cases suggested this phenomenon could also happen at resistance to cytotoxic drugs. According to the reported cases, a new target therapy or chemotherapy might be effective after SCC transformation. The mechanisms underlying transformation have not been fully elucidated and probably relate to multiple genetic alterations and cancer stem cells. Since the SCC transformation could happen under various circumstances, we recommend lung cancer patients to run the second biopsy after progression and conduct gene tests to elicit the mechanisms.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 36111030\nTitle: A lung adenocarcinoma patient with ROS1 fusion and NBN germline mutation achieves long progression-free survival from sintilimab combined with niraparib after failure of ROS1 inhibitors: a case report.\nAuthors: Xu F, Xiao C, Sun W\nJournal: Annals of translational medicine\nPublication Date: 2022 Aug\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is a malignant tumor with high morbidity and mortality worldwide. At present, the main treatment methods for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) include molecular targeted therapy and immunotherapy. The efficacy rate of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) monotherapy is relatively low. Studies have confirmed that some combination therapies have better anti-tumor efficacy and higher response rates, such as PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors combined with chemotherapy or targeted therapy. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have become a new line of cancer therapy in ovarian and breast cancer, but it's not approved in lung cancer. Some reports show that homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene variants may be potential biomarkers for immunotherapy. However, whether lung cancer with HRR gene variants can be benefit from ICIs combined with PARP inhibitors is unknown. CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of a 30-year-old man who was admitted to hospital with several months of cough and the chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed a mass about 2.6 cm x 2.1 cm in the left lung. Then he was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Next generation sequencing (NGS) revealed that he harbors ROS1 fusion and NBN germline mutation. So, he received platinum-based chemotherapy and ROS1 inhibitors, but the disease continued to progress. Ultimately, the patient was switched to sintilimab combined with niraparib and the efficacy was evaluated as stable disease (SD), with a progression-free survival (PFS) of more than 12 months, and the overall survival (OS) is 23 months up to now. During the treatment, the major adverse events (AEs) observed were lymphopenia, nausea, vomiting, and edema. The AEs were tolerable. CONCLUSIONS: This case shows that the combination of small-molecule inhibitors and immunotherapy may improve survival in NSCLC patients with driver genes, and sintilimab combined with niraparib provides a successful clinical case for the treatment of refractory tumors HRR gene mutation, which can be used as a reference for personalized treatment. Of course, more clinical trials are needed to confirm this combination treatment strategy.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

However, the clinical significance of PD-L1 expression in surgically resected EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma remains unclear. We conducted a real-world database of patients with surgically resected lung adenocarcinoma from 2015 to 2018 was constructed across 21 centers in Japan. The association among PD-L1 expression, EGFR mutations, and prognosis was evaluated. Among 847 patients, PD-L1 expression was negative (tumor proportion score [TPS] < 1%) in 429 (51%), weakly positive (TPS = 1%-49%) in 275 (32%), and strongly positive (TPS >/=50%) in 143 (17%) patients. EGFR mutations were detected in 331 (39%) patients. PD-L1 expression was associated with poor recurrence-free survival (RFS) (p < .001) in both EGFR-mutant and wild-type patients. However, in EGFR-mutant patients, PD-L1 expression was not associated with overall survival (OS) (p = .506). Multivariable analysis confirmed an association between PD-L1 expression and RFS but not OS. Furthermore, in EGFR-mutant patients treated with EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) treatment post-relapse, PD-L1 expression was not associated with overall response rate (p = .714), disease control rate (p = .554), or progression-free survival (p = .660). In conclusion, PD-L1 expression predicted poor RFS-independent EGFR status but did not show any association with OS in EGFR-mutant patients. The efficacy of post-relapse EGFR-TKI treatment was independent of PD-L1 expression. The significance of PD-L1 expression in perioperative EGFR-TKI therapy should be evaluated.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 34600407\nTitle: Programmed death-ligand 1 expression and its associations with clinicopathological features, prognosis, and driver oncogene alterations in surgically resected lung adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Takamochi K, Hara K, Hayashi T\nJournal: Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)\nPublication Date: 2021 Nov\nAbstract: OBJECTIVES: Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression is a predictive biomarker of response to immunotherapies targeting programmed death-1/PD-L1 in advanced-stage lung adenocarcinoma. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between PD-L1 expression and clinicopathological features, prognosis, and driver oncogene alterations in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated PD-L1 expression in 1,005 surgically resected lung adenocarcinoma specimens, by immunohistochemistry using the 22C3 antibody. PD-L1 positivity was defined based on the proportion of stained tumor cells (TPS) on tissue microarrays: <1% (negative), 1-49% (weakly positive), and >/= 50% (strongly positive). Correlations between PD-L1 expression and clinicopathological features, prognosis, and driver oncogene (EGFR, KRAS, ALK, ROS1, and RET) alterations in lung adenocarcinoma were analyzed. RESULTS: PD-L1 expression was negative in 726 (72%) of 1,005 tumors, weakly positive in 161 (16%), and strongly positive in 118 (12%). Male sex, smoking, elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels, advanced pathological stages, high-grade tumors, predominantly solid tumors, tumors with lymphatic permeation or vascular or pleural invasion, tumors without EGFR mutations, and tumors with KRAS mutations were more common in patients with PD-L1-positive tumors (TPS >/= 1%) than in those with PD-L1-negative tumors (TPS < 1%). PD-L1 positivity was not associated with ALK, ROS1, or RET fusion status. Although PD-L1 positivity was associated with poor overall survival and poor relapse-free survival in all patients, this was not statistically significant after adjusting for prognostic factors in the multivariate analysis. In the subgroup analysis according to driver oncogene alterations, PD-L1 positivity was associated with poor relapse-free survival only in patients with EGFR-mutated tumors. CONCLUSION: Surgically resected lung adenocarcinomas with increased PD-L1 expression were biologically aggressive tumors that frequently occurred in male smokers. PD-L1 expression and its prognostic significance differed according to driver oncogene alterations.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 39281386\nTitle: Intrinsic impacts of the expression of PD-L1 on postoperative recurrence in EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Ito A, Kano S, Tarukawa T\nJournal: Frontiers in oncology\nPublication Date: 2024\nAbstract: OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the intrinsic impacts of the expression of PD-L1 on postoperative recurrence and the prognosis in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated lung adenocarcinomas. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from 221 surgically resected pathological stage IA-IIIA lung adenocarcinomas, collected between 2017 and 2019, were analyzed. This included measurements of EGFR mutations and the PD-L1 expression. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using a Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test. The independent risk factors for RFS were assessed using univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Among the patients, 140 were PD-L1-negative (<1%), while 81 were PD-L1-positive (>/=1%). PD-L1 positivity was significantly associated with male sex (p=0.038), smoking habit (p=0.005), ND2 lymph node dissection (p=0.013), higher malignant subtype (p=0.003), higher histological grade (p=0.001), and advanced pathological stage (p=0.004). Conversely, EGFR mutations were more common in the PD-L1-negative group than in the PD-L1-positive group (p=0.006). Patients were categorized into four groups based on their EGFR mutation status and PD-L1 expression status: PD-L1-positive (>/=1%) with or without EGFR mutations (EGFR(+)/PD-L1>/=1% or EGFR (-)/PD-L1>/=1%), and PD-L1-negative (<1%) with or without EGFR mutations (EGFR(+)/PD-L1<1% or EGFR (-)/PD-L1<1%). Among these groups, EGFR(+)/PD-L1>/=1% cases exhibited the worst 5-year RFS (log-rank, p=0.010), while there was no significant difference in 5-year OS (log-rank, p=0.122). Furthermore, a multivariate analysis revealed that PD-L1 positivity was an independent significant factor for RFS in EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma (p=0.013). CONCLUSION: PD-L1 positivity emerged as an independent risk factor for RFS in patients with EGFR-mutant resected lung adenocarcinoma. These findings may provide valuable insights into the prognostic impact of PD-L1 expression and guide the implementation of postoperative adjuvant therapy in this patient population.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
