However, the most recent scans (age 57.152) indicate stabilization, with no further progression.\n   - The cancer is localized to the lung and pleura, and there is no evidence of widespread metastasis.\n\n2. **CEA Levels**:\n   - While CEA levels are elevated (5.8 ng/ml at age 57.371), they do not indicate a rapid decline in health or imminent mortality.\n\n3. **Performance Status**:\n   - The patient has an ECOG performance status of 0 as of age 57.371, indicating that the patient is fully active and asymptomatic.\n\n4. **Treatment and Stability**:\n   - The cancer has been stabilized with treatments, and there are no indications of severe complications or rapid health deterioration.\n\n5. **Genetic and Tumor Characteristics**:\n   - The tumor is microsatellite stable (MSS) and has a moderate tumor mutation burden (TMB), which may influence treatment options but does not directly predict mortality.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the stability of the cancer, the absence of rapid progression, and the patient\u2019s good performance status, it is highly likely that the patient will remain alive in the next 12 months.\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"

These levels suggest active cancer but do not necessarily indicate rapid decline.\n\n3. **Performance Status**:\n   - The patient\u2019s ECOG performance status has varied, ranging from 0 (fully active) to 2 (ambulatory but unable to work). At age 58.744, the ECOG status was 2, indicating some decline in physical function.\n\n4. **Treatment and Stability**:\n   - The patient has undergone radiation therapy (e.g., at ages 57.552 and 58.146), which may have contributed to periods of stability.\n   - Despite periods of progression, the cancer has not shown consistent or rapid worsening.\n\n5. **Recent Status**:\n   - The most recent scans at age 58.982 indicate no progression, suggesting that the disease is currently stable.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the cancer has shown progression and recurrence, the most recent scans indicate stability, and there is no evidence of rapid decline or life-threatening complications.
