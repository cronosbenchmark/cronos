These factors suggest a lower likelihood of aggressive recurrence.\n\n4. **Treatment and Functional Status**:\n   - The patient completed chemotherapy at age 66.245, with an improved ECOG performance status (from 1 to 0), indicating good functional recovery.\n\n5. **Imaging Results**:\n   - CT scans at ages 66.072 and 66.352 confirmed no progression of the disease.\n\n6. **Surgical Intervention**:\n   - There is a mention of a surgical procedure at age 66.385, but no details are provided about its nature or intent (e.g., curative resection or palliative).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe patient currently has stable disease with no evidence of progression or recurrence.

However, the patient remains ambulatory with an ECOG score of 1, and tumor markers have shown some responsiveness to treatment in the past. While the prognosis for advanced pancreatic cancer is generally poor, the patient\u2019s current functional status and ongoing treatment suggest a reasonable chance of survival over the next 6 months.\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"
