Normal levels are typically below 37 U/mL.\n   - The patient's CA 19-9 levels decreased significantly after treatment, from 59 U/mL (age 62.303) to 16-19 U/mL (ages 62.656 to 62.878).\n   - However, at age 63.048, the CA 19-9 level spiked to 95 U/mL, which is a concerning indicator of potential recurrence.\n\n5. **Performance Status**:\n   - The patient's ECOG performance status improved from 1 (age 62.368) to 0 (age 62.875), indicating good physical functioning.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe spike in CA 19-9 levels at age 63.048, despite prior normal levels and no progression on imaging, suggests a high likelihood of cancer recurrence within the next 6 months.
