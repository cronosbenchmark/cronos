This could indicate a potential recurrence or residual disease activity.\n   - However, the CT scan at age 71.160 still showed no progression.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe increase in CA 19-9 levels is concerning and may indicate early signs of recurrence, even though imaging has not yet confirmed progression. Given the patient's history and the recent rise in tumor markers, there is a possibility of recurrence within the next 6 months.\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"
