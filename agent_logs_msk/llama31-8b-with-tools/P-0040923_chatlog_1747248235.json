It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nCapecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers. Capecitabine is a prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to fluorouracil (antimetabolite) in the tumor, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor tissue.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

Oncology\nPublication Date: 2014 Dec\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Oxaliplatin-based adjuvant therapy is the standard of care for stage III colon cancer. Adjuvant capecitabine with or without oxaliplatin versus leucovorin and fluorouracil with or without oxaliplatin has not been directly compared; therefore, we aimed to analyse the efficacy and safety of these treatments using individual patient data pooled from four randomised controlled trials. We also assessed post-relapse survival, which has been postulated to be worse in patients receiving adjuvant oxaliplatin. METHODS: Patients with resected stage III colon cancer who were 18 years of age or older, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, from four randomised controlled trials (NSABP C-08, XELOXA, X-ACT, and AVANT; 8734 patients in total) were pooled and analysed. The treatment regimens included in our analyses were: XELOX (oxaliplatin and capecitabine); leucovorin and fluorouracil; capecitabine; FOLFOX-4 (leucovorin, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin); and modified FOLFOX-6 (mFOLFOX-6). Disease-free survival was the primary endpoint for all trials that supplied patients for this analysis. Here, we compared disease-free, relapse-free, and overall survival between the patient groups who received capecitabine with or without oxaliplatin and those who received leucovorin and fluorouracil with or without oxaliplatin. Post-relapse survival was compared between the combined XELOX and FOLFOX groups, and the leucovorin and fluorouracil groups. Post-relapse survival was also compared between the capecitabine with or without oxaliplatin and leucovorin and fluorouracil with or without oxaliplatin groups. FINDINGS: Disease-free survival did not differ significantly between patients who received leucovorin and fluorouracil versus those who received capecitabine in adjusted analyses (hazard ratio [HR] 1.02 [0.93-1.11; p=0.72]) or in unadjusted analyses (HR 1.01 [95% CI 0.92-1.10; p=0.86]). Relapse-free survival was similar (adjusted HR 1.02 [0.93-1.12; p=0.72] and unadjusted HR 1.01 [95% CI 0.92-1.11; p=0.86]), as was overall survival (adjusted HR 1.04 [95% CI 0.93-1.15; p=0.50] and unadjusted HR 1.02 [0.92-1.14]; p=0.65). For overall survival, a significant interaction between oxaliplatin and fluoropyrimidine was recorded in the multiple Cox regression analysis (p=0.014). Post-relapse survival was similar in adjusted (p=0.23) and unadjusted analyses (p=0.33) for the comparison of XELOX or FOLFOX versus leucovorin and fluorouracil, and was also similar for capecitabine-based regimens versus leucovorin and fluorouracil-based regimens (unadjusted p=0.26). INTERPRETATION: Combination therapy with oxaliplatin provided consistently improved outcomes without adversely affecting post-relapse survival in the adjuvant treatment of stage III colon cancer, irrespective of whether the fluoropyrimidine backbone was capecitabine or leucovorin and fluorouracil. These data add to the existing evidence that oxaliplatin plus capecitabine or leucovorin and fluorouracil is the standard of care for the adjuvant treatment of stage III colon cancer, and offers physicians flexibility to treat patients according to the patients' overall physical performance and preference.

We aimed to evaluate their patterns of use, association with survival, and rate of emergency room visit (ER) or hospitalization during the treatment period. High-risk stage II or III patients aged >65 years diagnosed between 2007 and 2015, underwent colectomy, and received any of these three regimens were selected from SEER and Texas Cancer Registry (TC) linked with Medicare data. Chi-square test, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, Cox regression, and logistic regression were used in data analysis. A total of 5621 (1080 stage II and 4541 stage III) patients with median age of 72 years were included in this study. For stage II, 24.4% used 5-FU/LV, 31.2% used capecitabine, and 44.4% used FLOX/OX; the respective numbers for stage III were 13.8%, 17.9%, and 68.3%. Patients aged <70 years, not in the West region, not in Medicare state-buy-in program, and with no comorbidity were more likely to use FLOX/OX. FLOX/OX was associated with improved overall survival (OS) in stage II and III patients and improved cancer-specific survival in stage III patients compared with 5-FU/LV. The survival benefit of FLOX/OX was sustained in stage III patients aged >/=70 years. Capecitabine had the lowest ER/hospitalization rate with 19.2% in stage II and 28.9% in III. The use of FLOX/OX was associated with improved survival compared with 5-FU/LV among CC patients. Capecitabine was associated with the lowest ER/hospitalization rate.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 25926352\nTitle: Phase II Trial of Preoperative Radiation With Concurrent Capecitabine, Oxaliplatin, and Bevacizumab Followed by Surgery and Postoperative 5-Fluorouracil, Leucovorin, Oxaliplatin (FOLFOX), and Bevacizumab in Patients With Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer: 5-Year Clinical Outcomes ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group E3204.\nAuthors: Landry JC, Feng Y, Prabhu RS\nJournal: The oncologist\nPublication Date: 2015 Jun\nAbstract: LESSONS LEARNED: The 5-year oncologic outcomes from the trial regimen were excellent. However, the neoadjuvant and surgical toxicity of this regimen was significant and was the primary reason for the low compliance with adjuvant systemic therapy.Due to the lack of an improvement in the pathologic complete response rate, the substantial associated toxicity, and the negative phase III trials of adjuvant bevacizumab in colon cancer, this regimen will not be pursued for further study. BACKGROUND: The addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy improves overall survival for metastatic colorectal cancer. We initiated a phase II trial to evaluate preoperative capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab with radiation therapy (RT) followed by surgery and postoperative 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin (FOLFOX), and bevacizumab for locally advanced rectal cancer. The purpose of this report is to describe the 5-year oncologic outcomes of this regimen. METHODS: In a phase II Simon two-stage design study, we evaluated preoperative treatment with capecitabine (825 mg/m(2) b.i.d. Monday-Friday), oxaliplatin (50 mg/m(2) weekly), bevacizumab (5 mg/kg on days 1, 15, and 29), and RT (50.4 Gy). Surgery was performed by 8 weeks after RT. Beginning 8-12 weeks after surgery, patients received FOLFOX plus bevacizumab (5 mg/kg) every 2 weeks for 12 cycles (oxaliplatin stopped after 9 cycles). The primary endpoint was a pathologic complete response (path-CR) rate of 30%. Fifty-seven patients with resectable T3/T4 rectal adenocarcinoma were enrolled between 2006 and 2010. RESULTS: Of 57 enrolled patients, 53 were eligible and included in the analysis. Forty-eight (91%) patients completed preoperative therapy, all of whom underwent curative surgical resection. Nine patients (17%) achieved path-CR. There were 29 worst grade 3 events, 8 worst grade 4 events, and 2 patient deaths, 1 of which was attributed to study therapy. Twenty-six patients (54%) began adjuvant chemotherapy. After a median follow-up period of 41 months, the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate for all patients was 80%. Only 2 patients experienced cancer recurrence: 1 distant (liver) and 1 loco-regional (pelvic lymph nodes), respectively. Both of these patients are still alive. The 5-year relapse-free survival rate was 81%. CONCLUSION: Despite the path-CR primary endpoint of this trial not being reached, the 5-year OS and recurrence-free survival rates were excellent. However, the neoadjuvant and surgical toxicity of this regimen was significant and was the primary reason for the low compliance with adjuvant systemic therapy. Because of the lack of an improvement in the path-CR rate, the substantial associated toxicity, and the negative phase III trials of adjuvant bevacizumab in colon cancer, this regimen will not be pursued for further study.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Three different dosing regimens were investigated in phase I studies: continuous monotherapy, intermittent monotherapy, and intermittent therapy supplemented with leucovorin. These studies defined the maximum tolerated dose for each regimen. Dose-limiting toxicities were diarrhea, hand-foot syndrome, and leukopenia. Each phase I study recommended a dose; these were directly compared in a phase II study. This phase II study showed that the intermittent regimen of capecitabine monotherapy was the most favorable on the basis of tumor response rates, time to progression, dose intensity, and toxicities. The intermittent regimen of capecitabine has been compared with the Mayo Clinic regimen of 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin in two large, phase III studies of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. The combined data from the two studies showed that capecitabine was superior to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin in terms of tumor response rate (22% v 13%; P < .0001) and similar in terms of time to disease progression and overall survival. Capecitabine is now being compared with the Mayo Clinic regimen as an adjuvant treatment for patients with Dukes' C colon cancer.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 31099282\nTitle: Retrospective comparison of efficacy and safety of CAPOX and FOLFOX regimens as adjuvant treatment in patients with stage III colon cancer.\nAuthors: Degirmencioglu S, Tanriverdi O, Demiray AG\nJournal: The Journal of international medical research\nPublication Date: 2019 Jun\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CAPOX) and 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) regimens as adjuvant treatment in patients with stage III colon cancer. METHODS: A total of 243 patients who received CAPOX and FOLFOX chemotherapy between 2014 and 2018 for stage III colon cancer in two centers were retrospectively studied. Among the patients, 106 (43.6%) and 137 (56.4%) were treated using CAPOX and FOLFOX regimens, respectively. Efficacy, treatment-related side effects, and overall survival rates with these two regimens were compared. RESULTS: The rate of disease progression was significantly higher in the presence of moderately/poorly differentiated histology, and KRAS and NRAS mutations. An increased number of metastatic lymph nodes and prolonged time from surgery to chemotherapy significantly increased disease progression. Patients who received CAPOX were significantly older than those who received FOLFOX. Disease progression, metastasis, and mortality rates were significantly higher in the FOLFOX arm than in the CAPOX arm. There was no significant difference in the overall survival rate between the two regimens. CONCLUSION: The CAPOX regimen is preferred in older patients. Disease progression, metastasis, and mortality rates are higher with FOLFOX than with CAPOX.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 23564831\nTitle: Response to chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer after exposure to oxaliplatin in the adjuvant setting.\nAuthors: Moreau LC, Rajan R, Thirlwell MP\nJournal: Anticancer research\nPublication Date: 2013 Apr\nAbstract: AIM: Oxaliplatin with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (FOLFOX and FLOX) or capecitabine (XELOX) is the standard adjuvant treatment for colonic cancer. In metastatic disease, 5-FU/leucovorin/irinotecan (FOLFIRI) and FOLFOX are equivalent in respect to response rates, progression-free and overall survival. Little data are available to compare their efficacy after exposure to oxaliplatin-containing adjuvant chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We carried out a retrospective study of patients who underwent surgery and FOLFOX adjuvant chemotherapy, followed by FOLFIRI or FOLFOX for metastatic disease. Exclusion criteria were: metastatic disease at presentation and no oxaliplatin in adjuvant chemotherapy. The end-point was the overall response rate (ORR) to first-line chemotherapy for metastatic disease after three months, as assessed by computed tomography (CT). RESULTS: A total of 205 patients received FOLFOX as adjuvant treatment for colorectal adenocarcinoma between 2006 and 2010. Metastatic disease was diagnosed later in 32 cases after a median follow-up of three years (range=1-5.5 years). The median time between the beginning of adjuvant chemotherapy and onset of metastatic disease was 1.7 years (range=0.5-5.5 years). Twenty-eight patients were evaluable for effects of treatment: six patients received FOLFOX plus bevacizumab and 22 FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab. The ORR was 17% in the FOLFOX group versus 36% in the FOLFIRI group (p=0.22). This difference was not statistically significant, despite a trend in favor of FOLFIRI. CONCLUSION: Metastatic disease after exposure to oxaliplatin in the adjuvant setting tends to occur early and can be characterized by partial resistance to this agent. Despite insufficient statistical power, our results suggest that FOLFIRI may result in higher response rates than FOLFOX in this situation. However, oxaliplatin re-challenge can also lead to radiological responses and disease stabilization.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Oncology\nPublication Date: 2014 Dec\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Oxaliplatin-based adjuvant therapy is the standard of care for stage III colon cancer. Adjuvant capecitabine with or without oxaliplatin versus leucovorin and fluorouracil with or without oxaliplatin has not been directly compared; therefore, we aimed to analyse the efficacy and safety of these treatments using individual patient data pooled from four randomised controlled trials. We also assessed post-relapse survival, which has been postulated to be worse in patients receiving adjuvant oxaliplatin. METHODS: Patients with resected stage III colon cancer who were 18 years of age or older, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, from four randomised controlled trials (NSABP C-08, XELOXA, X-ACT, and AVANT; 8734 patients in total) were pooled and analysed. The treatment regimens included in our analyses were: XELOX (oxaliplatin and capecitabine); leucovorin and fluorouracil; capecitabine; FOLFOX-4 (leucovorin, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin); and modified FOLFOX-6 (mFOLFOX-6). Disease-free survival was the primary endpoint for all trials that supplied patients for this analysis. Here, we compared disease-free, relapse-free, and overall survival between the patient groups who received capecitabine with or without oxaliplatin and those who received leucovorin and fluorouracil with or without oxaliplatin. Post-relapse survival was compared between the combined XELOX and FOLFOX groups, and the leucovorin and fluorouracil groups. Post-relapse survival was also compared between the capecitabine with or without oxaliplatin and leucovorin and fluorouracil with or without oxaliplatin groups. FINDINGS: Disease-free survival did not differ significantly between patients who received leucovorin and fluorouracil versus those who received capecitabine in adjusted analyses (hazard ratio [HR] 1.02 [0.93-1.11; p=0.72]) or in unadjusted analyses (HR 1.01 [95% CI 0.92-1.10; p=0.86]). Relapse-free survival was similar (adjusted HR 1.02 [0.93-1.12; p=0.72] and unadjusted HR 1.01 [95% CI 0.92-1.11; p=0.86]), as was overall survival (adjusted HR 1.04 [95% CI 0.93-1.15; p=0.50] and unadjusted HR 1.02 [0.92-1.14]; p=0.65). For overall survival, a significant interaction between oxaliplatin and fluoropyrimidine was recorded in the multiple Cox regression analysis (p=0.014). Post-relapse survival was similar in adjusted (p=0.23) and unadjusted analyses (p=0.33) for the comparison of XELOX or FOLFOX versus leucovorin and fluorouracil, and was also similar for capecitabine-based regimens versus leucovorin and fluorouracil-based regimens (unadjusted p=0.26). INTERPRETATION: Combination therapy with oxaliplatin provided consistently improved outcomes without adversely affecting post-relapse survival in the adjuvant treatment of stage III colon cancer, irrespective of whether the fluoropyrimidine backbone was capecitabine or leucovorin and fluorouracil. These data add to the existing evidence that oxaliplatin plus capecitabine or leucovorin and fluorouracil is the standard of care for the adjuvant treatment of stage III colon cancer, and offers physicians flexibility to treat patients according to the patients' overall physical performance and preference.

We aimed to evaluate their patterns of use, association with survival, and rate of emergency room visit (ER) or hospitalization during the treatment period. High-risk stage II or III patients aged >65 years diagnosed between 2007 and 2015, underwent colectomy, and received any of these three regimens were selected from SEER and Texas Cancer Registry (TC) linked with Medicare data. Chi-square test, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, Cox regression, and logistic regression were used in data analysis. A total of 5621 (1080 stage II and 4541 stage III) patients with median age of 72 years were included in this study. For stage II, 24.4% used 5-FU/LV, 31.2% used capecitabine, and 44.4% used FLOX/OX; the respective numbers for stage III were 13.8%, 17.9%, and 68.3%. Patients aged <70 years, not in the West region, not in Medicare state-buy-in program, and with no comorbidity were more likely to use FLOX/OX. FLOX/OX was associated with improved overall survival (OS) in stage II and III patients and improved cancer-specific survival in stage III patients compared with 5-FU/LV. The survival benefit of FLOX/OX was sustained in stage III patients aged >/=70 years. Capecitabine had the lowest ER/hospitalization rate with 19.2% in stage II and 28.9% in III.

However, the neoadjuvant and surgical toxicity of this regimen was significant and was the primary reason for the low compliance with adjuvant systemic therapy.Due to the lack of an improvement in the pathologic complete response rate, the substantial associated toxicity, and the negative phase III trials of adjuvant bevacizumab in colon cancer, this regimen will not be pursued for further study. BACKGROUND: The addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy improves overall survival for metastatic colorectal cancer. We initiated a phase II trial to evaluate preoperative capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab with radiation therapy (RT) followed by surgery and postoperative 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin (FOLFOX), and bevacizumab for locally advanced rectal cancer. The purpose of this report is to describe the 5-year oncologic outcomes of this regimen. METHODS: In a phase II Simon two-stage design study, we evaluated preoperative treatment with capecitabine (825 mg/m(2) b.i.d. Monday-Friday), oxaliplatin (50 mg/m(2) weekly), bevacizumab (5 mg/kg on days 1, 15, and 29), and RT (50.4 Gy). Surgery was performed by 8 weeks after RT. Beginning 8-12 weeks after surgery, patients received FOLFOX plus bevacizumab (5 mg/kg) every 2 weeks for 12 cycles (oxaliplatin stopped after 9 cycles). The primary endpoint was a pathologic complete response (path-CR) rate of 30%. Fifty-seven patients with resectable T3/T4 rectal adenocarcinoma were enrolled between 2006 and 2010. RESULTS: Of 57 enrolled patients, 53 were eligible and included in the analysis. Forty-eight (91%) patients completed preoperative therapy, all of whom underwent curative surgical resection. Nine patients (17%) achieved path-CR. There were 29 worst grade 3 events, 8 worst grade 4 events, and 2 patient deaths, 1 of which was attributed to study therapy. Twenty-six patients (54%) began adjuvant chemotherapy. After a median follow-up period of 41 months, the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate for all patients was 80%. Only 2 patients experienced cancer recurrence: 1 distant (liver) and 1 loco-regional (pelvic lymph nodes), respectively. Both of these patients are still alive. The 5-year relapse-free survival rate was 81%. CONCLUSION: Despite the path-CR primary endpoint of this trial not being reached, the 5-year OS and recurrence-free survival rates were excellent. However, the neoadjuvant and surgical toxicity of this regimen was significant and was the primary reason for the low compliance with adjuvant systemic therapy. Because of the lack of an improvement in the path-CR rate, the substantial associated toxicity, and the negative phase III trials of adjuvant bevacizumab in colon cancer, this regimen will not be pursued for further study.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

        "content": "Based on the information provided in the PubMed search results, I can see that there are several articles related to the treatment of colon adenocarcinoma with chemotherapy agents such as fluorouracil, leucovorin, and capecitabine.\n\nArticle #1 discusses the effect of adjuvant capecitabine or fluorouracil, with or without oxaliplatin, on survival outcomes in stage III colon cancer. The study found that disease-free survival, relapse-free survival, and overall survival did not differ significantly between patients who received leucovorin and fluorouracil versus those who received capecitabine.\n\nArticle #2 discusses the adjuvant 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, capecitabine, and oxaliplatin-related regimens for stage II/III colon cancer patients 66 years or older. The study found that the use of FLOX/OX was associated with improved overall survival and cancer-specific survival in stage II and III patients compared with 5-FU/LV.\n\nArticle #3 discusses the phase II trial of preoperative radiation with concurrent capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab followed by surgery and postoperative 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin (FOLFOX), and bevacizumab in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. The study found that the 5-year overall survival rate for all patients was 80%, and the 5-year relapse-free survival rate was 81%.\n\nBased on this information, I can conclude that the patient's treatment with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and capecitabine is consistent with standard treatment protocols for colon adenocarcinoma.\n\nHowever, I still need to determine the likelihood of the patient being still alive in the next 12 months. To do this, I would like to analyze the patient's CEA levels and other clinical data.\n\nBased on the information provided in the files \"specimen.txt\" and \"timeline0.txt\", I can see that the patient's most recent CEA level is 3.1 ng/ml, which is slightly elevated.\n\nConsidering the patient's age, sex, and cancer type, as well as the treatment regimen and CEA level, I would estimate the likelihood of the patient being still alive in the next 12 months as follows:\n\nA) Yes\nB) No\n\nBased on the information provided, I would choose:\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"
