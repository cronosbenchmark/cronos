To understand the clinical benefits of antiangiogenic agents, the efficacy of chemotherapy containing bevacizmab was investigated in patients with lung adenocarcinoma-induced MPE. METHODS: The data of lung adenocarcinoma patients with MPE treated with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy on day 1, every three weeks, for </= 6 cycles was retrospectively collected. Patients who achieved a response or stable disease were administered bevacizumab as maintenance therapy until progression. The primary outcomes of the study were MPE response rate (RR), MPE control rate, and pleural progression-free survival (PPFS), while the secondary outcomes were PFS, overall survival (OS), changes to the lung volume and thoracic cage, and safety profiles. RESULTS: A total of 21 cases were collected, and all were evaluable for response, including 15 chemotherapy-naive patients and 6 who experienced relapse. The median cycle of treatments was 7 (1-42) and 5 (2-6) for bevacizumab and chemotherapy, respectively. The MPE RR reached 81.0%. The MPE control rate at 6, 12, 24, 48, and 96 weeks were 95.2%, 90.0%, 89.5%, 73.7%, and 43.8%, respectively. Median PPFS was significantly longer than PFS (22.2 vs. 7.8 months; P = 0.044), and median OS was 25.8 months. Nineteen (90.5%) patients experienced lung re-expansion after treatment. Only one (4.8%) patient suffered thoracic volume decrease during treatment and the follow-up period. No unexpected adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy demonstrated efficacious, persistence, and safety in controlling lung cancer-induced MPE, indicating a potential superior therapeutic option.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 37658844\nTitle: Lung adenocarcinoma with micropapillary and solid patterns: Recurrence rate and trends.\nAuthors: Takeno N, Tarumi S, Abe M\nJournal: Thoracic cancer\nPublication Date: 2023 Oct\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Lung adenocarcinomas with micropapillary pattern (MP) or solid pattern (SP) have poor prognosis with frequent postoperative recurrence. However, treatment strategies for these histological subtypes have not been established. This study examined the recurrence rates and patterns in patients with these histological subtypes. METHODS: Overall, 238 patients with lung adenocarcinoma who underwent radical resection were included. According to the histological subtypes, the patients were classified into three groups: neither MP nor SP (MP-/SP-), MP (MP+), and SP (SP+). The clinical and pathological characteristics and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were examined in each group. In addition, univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to investigate the recurrence factors. The site of recurrence, PD-L1 expression, and driver mutations were examined in patients with postoperative recurrence. RESULTS: The recurrence rates were significantly higher in the MP+ and SP+ groups (p = 0.01). The RFS was significantly shorter in the MP+ and SP+ groups (p < 0.001) than in the MP-/SP- group, especially in pStage 1A (p = 0.001). The relationship between recurrence and pathologic factors was significant for pleural, lymphatic, and vascular invasion, as well as MP in univariate analysis and only for MP in multivariate analysis. Most recurrences were distant metastases in the MP+ and SP+ groups. PD-L1 was highly expressed in recurrent SP+ cases. CONCLUSIONS: Early-stage lung adenocarcinoma with MP or SP frequently has postoperative recurrence. Prevention of distant metastases is important in these patients to improve prognosis, and aggressive postoperative chemotherapy may be considered.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 32442617\nTitle: LKB1/STK11 Expression in Lung Adenocarcinoma and Associations With Patterns of Recurrence.\nAuthors: Mitchell KG, Parra ER, Zhang J\nJournal: The Annals of thoracic surgery\nPublication Date: 2020 Oct\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Mutations in the serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK11)/liver kinase B1 (LKB1) have been implicated in mediating resistance to checkpoint blockade among patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma. We sought to examine the associations between clinicopathologic characteristics, tumor LKB1 expression, features of the immune microenvironment, and postoperative prognosis among patients with early stage lung adenocarcinoma undergoing surgical therapy. METHODS: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens of patients undergoing resection of stage I to III, chemotherapy-naive adenocarcinomas (1997 to 2008) were analyzed using tissue microarray sectioning. Sublobar resections were excluded. Intratumoral LKB1/STK11 expression was quantified as H-score. In a subset, tumor-associated immune cell populations were quantified using whole tumor sections in peritumoral and intratumoral compartments. RESULTS: In all, 104 patients met inclusion criteria. Expression of LKB1/STK11 (median H-score 102.9) was higher in women (median 123.3) than in men (100, P = .004) and in never-smokers (median 145) than in former/current smokers (100, P = .002). Expression of LKB1/STK11 was positively correlated with intratumoral infiltration of cluster of differentiation (CD) 3(+) (r = 0.351, P = .005), CD4(+) (r = 0.436, P < .001), and CD8(+) (r = 0.263, P = .049) cells. Patients with extrathoracic recurrence had lower tumor expression of LKB1/STK11 than did other patients with recurrent disease. On multivariate analysis, low LKB1/STK11 expression remained independently associated with poor disease-free survival and distant disease-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: Low LKB1/STK11 expression is associated with specific patient characteristics and poor postoperative prognosis in chemotherapy-naive lung adenocarcinoma. Further investigation is warranted to delineate its clinical significance in the context of evaluating novel therapeutic agents in patients with resectable disease.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Immunotherapy is an effective treatment for lung adenocarcinoma but is restricted by many factors including immune checkpoint expression and the inhibitory immune microenvironment. This study aimed to explore the immune microenvironment in lung adenocarcinoma via disulfidptosis. METHODS: Public datasets of lung adenocarcinoma from the TCGA and GEO was adopted as the training and validation cohort. Based on the differences in the expression of disulfidptosis -related genes, a glucose metabolism and immune response prognostic model was constructed. The prognostic value and clinical relationship of the model were further explored. Immune-related analyses were performed according to CIBERSORT, ssGSEA, TIDE, IPS. RESULTS: We verified that the model could accurately predict the survival expectancy of lung adenocarcinoma patients. Patients with lung adenocarcinoma and a low-risk score had better survival outcomes according to the model. Moreover, the high-risk group tended to have an immunosuppressive effect, as reflected by the immune cell components, phenotypes and functions. We also found that the clinically relevant immune checkpoint CTLA-4 was significantly higher in low-risk group (P<0.05), indicating that the high-risk group may suffer worse tumor immunotherapy efficacy. Finally, we found that this model has accurate predictive value for the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade in non-small cell lung cancer (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The prognostic model demonstrated the feasibility of predicting survival and immunotherapy efficacy via disulfidptosis-related genes and will facilitate the development of personalized anticancer therapy.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 39107445\nTitle: Prediction of lung adenocarcinoma prognosis and diagnosis with a novel model anchored in circadian clock-related genes.\nAuthors: Sun Q, Zheng S, Tang W\nJournal: Scientific reports\nPublication Date: 2024 Aug 6\nAbstract: Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common primary lung cancer seen in the world, and identifying genetic markers is essential for predicting the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma and improving treatment outcomes. It is well known that alterations in circadian rhythms are associated with a higher risk of cancer. Moreover, circadian rhythms play a regulatory role in the human body. Therefore, studying the changes in circadian rhythms in cancer patients is crucial for optimizing treatment. The gene expression data and clinical data were sourced from TCGA database, and we identified the circadian clock-related genes. We used the obtained TCGA-LUAD data set to build the model, and the other 647 lung adenocarcinoma patients' data were collected from two GEO data sets for external verification. A risk score model for circadian clock-related genes was constructed, based on the identification of 8 genetically significant genes. Based on ROC analyses, the risk model demonstrated a high level of accuracy in predicting the overall survival times of lung adenocarcinoma patients in training folds, as well as external data sets. This study has successfully constructed a risk model for lung adenocarcinoma prognosis, utilizing circadian rhythm as its foundation. This model demonstrates a dependable capacity to forecast the outcome of the disease, which can further guide the relevant mechanism of lung adenocarcinoma and combine behavioral therapy with treatment to optimize treatment decision-making.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 38364745\nTitle: Survival outcomes of targeted and immune consolidation therapies in locally advanced unresectable lung adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Wang X, Meng X, Cai G\nJournal: International immunopharmacology\nPublication Date: 2024 Mar 10\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) presents unique challenges due to its progression and tumor heterogeneity. The effectiveness of consolidation therapies, particularly in patients with gene mutations, remains an area of active investigation. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we examined data from 3,454 patients with unresectable lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), narrowing our focus to 242 individuals with stage II/III. We gathered patient data, such as demographics, ECOG status, histology, treatment specifics, and gene expression, from patients in China. The study's primary outcome was overall survival (OS), while progression-free survival (PFS) served as the secondary outcome. RESULTS: In this study, 50 % of the 242 patients underwent only radical chemoradiotherapy, with 45.87 % (111/242) exhibiting driver gene mutations, predominantly EGFR (58.57 %), followed by KRAS and ALK. Patients with mutations who received either targeted or immune consolidation therapy demonstrated a significantly longer median PFS (42.97 months vs. 24.87 months, p = 0.014) and improved OS (not reached vs. 24.37 months, p = 0.006), compared to those without consolidation therapy. Targeted therapy in mutant patients resulted in an extended median PFS (42.87 months) compared to immune therapy (27.03 months, p = 0.029), with no significant difference in OS. Median PFS and OS were similar between mutant and wild-type patients receiving immune therapy (p = 0.380 and p = 0.928, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study underscores the efficacy of targeted consolidation therapy in enhancing PFS in LUAD patients with genetic mutations. It also shows that immune consolidation therapy provides similar survival benefits to mutant and wild-type patients. Future research should focus on optimizing these therapies for improved patient outcomes.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
