However, treatment strategies for these histological subtypes have not been established. This study examined the recurrence rates and patterns in patients with these histological subtypes. METHODS: Overall, 238 patients with lung adenocarcinoma who underwent radical resection were included. According to the histological subtypes, the patients were classified into three groups: neither MP nor SP (MP-/SP-), MP (MP+), and SP (SP+). The clinical and pathological characteristics and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were examined in each group. In addition, univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to investigate the recurrence factors. The site of recurrence, PD-L1 expression, and driver mutations were examined in patients with postoperative recurrence. RESULTS: The recurrence rates were significantly higher in the MP+ and SP+ groups (p = 0.01). The RFS was significantly shorter in the MP+ and SP+ groups (p < 0.001) than in the MP-/SP- group, especially in pStage 1A (p = 0.001). The relationship between recurrence and pathologic factors was significant for pleural, lymphatic, and vascular invasion, as well as MP in univariate analysis and only for MP in multivariate analysis. Most recurrences were distant metastases in the MP+ and SP+ groups. PD-L1 was highly expressed in recurrent SP+ cases. CONCLUSIONS: Early-stage lung adenocarcinoma with MP or SP frequently has postoperative recurrence. Prevention of distant metastases is important in these patients to improve prognosis, and aggressive postoperative chemotherapy may be considered.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 36943079\nTitle: Recurrence Patterns and Patient Outcomes in Resected Lung Adenocarcinoma Differ according to Ground-Glass Opacity at CT.\nAuthors: Park S, Lee SM, Choe J\nJournal: Radiology\nPublication Date: 2023 May\nAbstract: Background Although lung adenocarcinoma with ground-glass opacity (GGO) is known to have distinct characteristics, limited data exist on whether the recurrence pattern and outcomes in patients with resected lung adenocarcinoma differ according to GGO presence at CT. Purpose To examine recurrence patterns and associations with outcomes in patients with resected lung adenocarcinoma according to GGO at CT. Materials and Methods Patients who underwent CT followed by lobectomy or pneumonectomy for lung adenocarcinoma between July 2010 and December 2017 were retrospectively included. Patients were divided into two groups based on the presence of GGO: GGO adenocarcinoma and solid adenocarcinoma. Recurrence patterns at follow-up CT examinations were investigated and compared between the two groups. The effects of patient grouping on time to recurrence, postrecurrence survival (PRS), and overall survival (OS) were evaluated using Cox regression. Results Of 1019 patients (mean age, 62 years +/- 9 [SD]; 520 women), 487 had GGO adenocarcinoma and 532 had solid adenocarcinoma. Recurrences occurred more frequently in patients with solid adenocarcinoma (36.1% [192 of 532 patients]) than in those with GGO adenocarcinoma (16.2% [79 of 487 patients]). Distant metastasis was the most common mode of recurrence in the group with solid adenocarcinoma and all clinical stages. In clinical stage I GGO adenocarcinoma, all regional recurrences appeared as ipsilateral lung metastasis (39.2% [20 of 51]) without regional lymph node metastasis. Brain metastasis was more frequent in patients with clinical stage I solid adenocarcinoma (16.5% [16 of 97 patients]). The presence of GGO was associated with time to recurrence and OS (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.6 [P < .001] for both). Recurrence pattern was an independent risk factor for PRS (adjusted HR, 2.1 for distant metastasis [P < .001] and 3.9 for brain metastasis [P < .001], with local-regional recurrence as the reference). Conclusion Recurrence patterns, time to recurrence, and overall survival differed between patients with and without ground-glass opacity at CT, and recurrence patterns were associated with postrecurrence survival.

It is well known that alterations in circadian rhythms are associated with a higher risk of cancer. Moreover, circadian rhythms play a regulatory role in the human body. Therefore, studying the changes in circadian rhythms in cancer patients is crucial for optimizing treatment. The gene expression data and clinical data were sourced from TCGA database, and we identified the circadian clock-related genes. We used the obtained TCGA-LUAD data set to build the model, and the other 647 lung adenocarcinoma patients' data were collected from two GEO data sets for external verification. A risk score model for circadian clock-related genes was constructed, based on the identification of 8 genetically significant genes. Based on ROC analyses, the risk model demonstrated a high level of accuracy in predicting the overall survival times of lung adenocarcinoma patients in training folds, as well as external data sets. This study has successfully constructed a risk model for lung adenocarcinoma prognosis, utilizing circadian rhythm as its foundation. This model demonstrates a dependable capacity to forecast the outcome of the disease, which can further guide the relevant mechanism of lung adenocarcinoma and combine behavioral therapy with treatment to optimize treatment decision-making.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

It was generated by grafting the variable sequences of a very high-affinity mouse antihuman PD-1 antibody onto a human IgG4-kappa isotype containing a stabilizing S228P Fc mutation.[A18829] It contains 32 cysteine residues and the complete folded molecule includes 4 disulfide linkages as interchain bonds and 23 interchain bonds.[F136] It was developed by Merck & Co and first approved for the treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma by the FDA on September 4, 2014,[L2954] becoming the first approved therapy against PD-1.[A7624] In the time since its initial approval, pembrolizumab has been granted approval in the treatment of a wide variety of cancers.[L38934,L43257]\nLenvatinib: Lenvatinib is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor that inhibits the kinase activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4). Lenvatinib also inhibits other RTKs that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4; the platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR\u03b1), KIT, and RET. These receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) located in the cell membrane play a central role in the activation of signal transduction pathways involved in the normal regulation of cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis and differentiation, and in pathogenic angiogenesis, lymphogenesis, tumour growth and cancer progression. In particular, VEGF has been identified as a crucial regulator of both physiologic and pathologic angiogenesis and increased expression of VEGF is associated with a poor prognosis in many types of cancers.\r\n\r\nLenvatinib is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioactive iodine (RAI)-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. Most patients with thyroid cancer have a very good prognosis with treatment (98% 5 year survival rate) involving surgery and hormone therapy. However, for patients with RAI-refractory thyroid cancer, treatment options are limited and the prognosis is poor, leading to a push for the development of more targeted therapies such as lenvatinib.\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: timeline0.txt] included in your context\nAGE: 65.322, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: Yes, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 65.322, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 65.322, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), CT, TUMOR_SITE: Lung, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 65.350, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: PET, HAS_CANCER: Yes, PROCEDURE_TYPE: PET, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: Yes, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 65.350, diagnosis > progression --> PROGRESSION: N, PROCEDURE_TYPE: PET, \nAGE: 65.350, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), PET, TUMOR_SITE: Lung, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, HEAD: Yes, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 65.383, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, HAS_CANCER: Yes, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 65.383, diagnosis > progression --> PROGRESSION: N, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, \nAGE: 65.383, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), MR, TUMOR_SITE: Other, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 65.407, samples > clinical_sample --> SAMPLE_ID: P-0041506-T01-IM6, PATIENT_ID: P-0041506, CANCER_TYPE: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, SAMPLE_TYPE: Primary, SAMPLE_CLASS: Tumor, METASTATIC_SITE: Not Applicable, PRIMARY_SITE: Lung, CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED: Lung Adenocarcinoma, GENE_PANEL: IMPACT468, SAMPLE_COVERAGE: 785, TUMOR_PURITY: 30.0, ONCOTREE_CODE: LUAD, MSI_COMMENT: MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).
