Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nCapecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers.

Due to the poor clinical outcomes, it is indispensable to investigate novel biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of COAD. The aim of this study is to explore key genes as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of COAD for clinical utility. Gene expression profiles (GSE44076 and GSE44861) and gene methylation profile (GSE29490) were analyzed to identify the aberrantly methylated-differentially expressed genes by R language and Perl software. Function enrichments were performed by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway. Moreover, hub genes were identified through protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Besides, key genes were found by the module analysis and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) survival analysis. Finally, TCGA data and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to validate the key genes involved in COAD. Our study found two hypomethylation-high-expression genes (CXCL3 and CXCL8) in COAD tissues compared with the adjacent normal tissues. These results were also confirmed by RT-qPCR with 25 pairs of COAD and adjacent normal tissues. Meanwhile, low expression of the two genes was associated with poor survival in patients with COAD. CXCL3 and CXCL8 may serve as key genes in the diagnosis and prognosis for COAD.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 38867070\nTitle: To explore the prognostic characteristics of colon cancer based on tertiary lymphoid structure-related genes and reveal the characteristics of tumor microenvironment and drug prediction.\nAuthors: Wang Z, Niu D\nJournal: Scientific reports\nPublication Date: 2024 Jun 12\nAbstract: In order to construct a prognostic evaluation model of TLS features in COAD and better realize personalized precision medicine in COAD. Colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) is a common malignant tumor of the digestive system. At present, there is no effective prognostic marker to predict the prognosis of patients. Tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) affects cancer progression by regulating immune microenvironment. Mining COAD biomarkers based on TLS-related genes helps to improve the prognosis of patients. In order to construct a prognostic evaluation model of TLS features in COAD and better realize personalized precision medicine in COAD. The mRNA expression data and clinical information of COAD and adjacent tissues were downloaded from the Cancer Genome Atlas database. The differentially expressed TLS-related genes of COAD relative to adjacent tissues were obtained by differential analysis. TLS gene co-expression analysis was used to mine genes highly related to TLS, and the intersection of the two was used to obtain candidate genes. Univariate, LASSO, and multivariate Cox regression analysis were performed on candidate genes to screen prognostic markers to construct a risk assessment model. The differences of immune characteristics were evaluated by ESTIMATE, ssGSEA and CIBERSORT in high and low risk groups of prognostic model. The difference of genomic mutation between groups was evaluated by tumor mutation burden score. Screening small molecule drugs through the GDSC library. Finally, a nomogram was drawn to evaluate the clinical value of the prognostic model. Seven TLS-related genes ADAM8, SLC6A1, PAXX, RIMKLB, PTH1R, CD1B, and MMP10 were screened to construct a prognostic model. Survival analysis showed that patients in the high-risk group had significantly lower overall survival rates. Immune microenvironment analysis showed that patients in the high-risk group had higher immune indicators, indicating higher immunity. The genomic mutation patterns of the high-risk and low-risk groups were significantly different, especially the KRAS mutation frequency was significantly higher in the high-risk group. Drug sensitivity analysis showed that the low-risk group was more sensitive to Erlotinib, Savolitinib and VE _ 822, which may be used as a potential drug for COAD treatment. Finally, the nomogram constructed by pathological features combined with RiskScore can accurately evaluate the prognosis of COAD patients. This study constructed and verified a TLS model that can predict COAD. More importantly, it provides a reference standard for guiding the prognosis and immunotherapy of COAD patients.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 36681801\nTitle: Expression patterns and prognostic value of key regulators associated with m7G RNA modification based on all gene expression in colon adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Zhu Y, Zhao Z, Thandar M\nJournal: BMC gastroenterology\nPublication Date: 2023 Jan 21\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: N7-methylguanosine (m7G) is present in a wide variety of organisms and has important roles. m7G has been reported to be involved in multiple biological processes, and recent studies have reported that changes in RNA modifications result in tumor cellular transformation and cancer, such as colon adenocarcinoma, lung cancer, and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. However, little is known about the function of the m7G in colon adenocarcinoma. METHODS: We established two clusters based on the expression of all genes associated with m7G to explore the expression pattern of 31 key regulatory factors of m7G RNA and assess the prognostic value of regulatory factors. Wilcoxon test and differential box line plots were applied for bioinformatics analysis. Receiver Operating and Kaplan\u2012Meier curves were utilized to evaluate the prognostic value. Finally, four genes' expression in the colon cancer cell line was confirmed by qRT-PCR. RESULTS: From The Cancer Genome Atlas database, we found that the expression levels of 25 out of the 31 key N7-methylguanosine RNA modification regulators were significantly different in colon adenocarcinoma. According to 25 methylation regulators' expression, we identified two subgroups by consensus clustering, in which the prognosis was worse in Group 2 than in Group 1 and was significantly correlated with age. Cluster 2 was significantly enriched in tumor-associated pathways, and immune cells were highly infiltrated in Cluster 1 but weakly infiltrated in Cluster 2. Further results indicated that this risk profile may serve as a standalone predictive factor for colon adenocarcinoma, and the four genetic risk profiles' prognostic relatedness was successfully verified through Gene Expression Omnibus dataset. At last, A nomogram for prognosis was created according to age, sex, histological grading, clinicopathological staging, and hazard score to accurately predict patient prognosis in colon adenocarcinoma. We successfully validated the differential expression of four genes using qRT-PCR. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, we revealed the important contribution of key regulators associated with m7G RNA modifications based on all gene expression in colon adenocarcinoma and developed a signature of risk that serves as a promising prognostic marker for patients with colon adenocarcinoma.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Herein, we report a patient with MiNEN of the colon with metastases to the liver and the thyroid gland, with long-term survival. A 45-year-old man presented with anterior neck swelling. Histopathological examination of the thyroid tumor revealed neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC), suggesting that a primary NEC in another organ had metastasized to the thyroid gland. Computed tomography to identify a primary NEC revealed two tumors: one in the liver and one in the transverse colon. A biopsy revealed that the histopathology of the liver and colon tumors was NEC and adenocarcinoma, respectively. Thereafter, the patient underwent surgical resection of the colon tumor and was finally diagnosed as colon MiNEN with metastases to the thyroid and liver. The surgical resection of the metastatic liver tumor was performed after several courses of systemic chemotherapy, and the patient survives presently without any recurrence for approximately seven years after the diagnosis. Surgical resection of each metastatic lesion combined with systematic chemotherapy apparently improved the prognosis of MiNEN of the colon with distant metastases.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 28314254\nTitle: Synchronous Endometrial and Ovarian Cancer in Young Women: Case Report and Review of the Literature.\nAuthors: Dogan A, Schultheis B, Rezniczek GA\nJournal: Anticancer research\nPublication Date: 2017 Mar\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Young women with endometrial cancer (EC) have an increased risk of synchronous ovarian cancer. The prognosis of women with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancer (SEOC) is good. A high proportion of affected women have hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer syndrome (HNPCC). CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 45-year-old woman with histologically proven endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium (pT1B, G2, R0 without lymphovascular space invasion). She underwent laparoscopic hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and pelvic lymphadenectomy. Final histology revealed a synchronous bilateral endometrioid ovarian cancer (pT1A, G2, R0). HNPCC analysis by immunohistochemistry showed no microsatellite instability in MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, and PMS2. No adjuvant therapy was administered, clinical follow-up with regular gynecological examinations was recommended. In a systematic literature review, 2,904 cases of women with SEOC were identified with 1,035 (36%) of them being premenopausal or <50 years of age. The proportion of women with SEOC among all reported EC cases was 842/23,498 (3%) and the proportion of young women with SEOC among all reported EC cases was 261/23,498 (1%). In summary, microsatellite instability and subsequent mutations in mismatch repair genes compatible with HNPCC were identified in 6/15 (40%) women analyzed. The mean recurrence-free and overall survival times of young women with SEOC were 1.9 (min 0.2, max 3) and 4.0 (min 0.2, max 22.1) years, respectively. CONCLUSION: Young women with EC have a high risk of synchronous ovarian cancer. Thus, in young women with EC, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or careful histological assessment of both ovaries are recommended in order to confirm or rule out SEOC. HNPCC testing should be offered to all women.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 31615647\nTitle: [Epidemiology, treatment and prognosis of colorectal cancer in young adults in sub-Saharan Africa].\nAuthors: Ouedraogo S, Tapsoba TW, Bere B\nJournal: Bulletin du cancer\nPublication Date: 2019 Nov\nAbstract: Colorectal cancer is the most common digestive cancer. The objectives of this study was to analyse the frequency, aetiologies, and the therapeutic and progressive aspects of colorectal cancer in young adults in Burkina Faso. This study was a 10-years descriptive study conducted in 2 regional hospitals in Burkina Faso. It included all patients aged 20 to 45 years admitted to these two hospitals for colon cancer or rectal cancer during the study period. A total of 116 patients were included, which was 39.2% of all patients admitted for colorectal cancer during the same period. The average age of the included patients was 35.4 years old. There were 70 male patients (60.3%). Seven patients had a history of chronic inflammatory bowel disease, and six had a family history of colon cancer. The average consultation time was 6.2 months. In 25 cases (19.9%), the cancer was discovered in the context of an abdominal emergency. Ninety-two patients (79.3%) were diagnosed at stage 3 or stage 4 according to the TNM Staging System. The most common histological type was adenocarcinoma (103 cases, 88.9%). Therapeutically, surgery was performed on 87 patients (75%) and chemotherapy was used in 37 cases (31.9%). Sixteen patients received radiotherapy. The intra operative mortality rate was 4.6%. The 5-year survival rate was 17%. In conclusion, colorectal cancer in young adults occurs without obvious risk factors in Burkina Faso. Mortality remains high because of the limited therapeutic arsenal.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

The patient underwent surgical resection of the colon tumor and received systemic chemotherapy, and he survived for approximately seven years after the diagnosis.\n\nArticle #2 discusses the case of a 45-year-old woman with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancer. The patient underwent laparoscopic hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and pelvic lymphadenectomy, and she did not receive adjuvant therapy. The study suggests that young women with endometrial cancer have an increased risk of synchronous ovarian cancer.\n\nArticle #3 discusses the epidemiology, treatment, and prognosis of colorectal cancer in young adults in sub-Saharan Africa. The study found that the 5-year survival rate for colon cancer in young adults in Burkina Faso was 17%.\n\nBased on these studies, I can see that the prognosis of colon adenocarcinoma in patients of different ages can vary depending on several factors, including the stage of the disease, the presence of metastases, and the effectiveness of treatment.\n\nHowever, I do not have enough information to determine the likelihood of cancer progression in the next 12 months for the patient in question.
