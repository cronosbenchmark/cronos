Preoperative levels correlated directly with surgical-pathologic state and inversely with the time of recurrence; i.e., groups of patients with more advanced stage showed higher proportion of elevated CEA levels, and patients with higher levels had recurrences earlier. Levels above 20 ng/ml were strongly suggestive of liver metastases or disseminated disease. Postoperative plasma CEA levels displayed three patterns of variation. 1) Levels fluctuating within normal range, below 3.2 ng/ml, strongly evidenced that surgery was effective, and 2) those fluctuating below 7.5 ng/ml indicated usually nonmalignant concomitant disease; in either group no more than 10 per cent of the patients had recurrences. 3) Levels rising persistently from a postoperative nadir indicated recurrence or, when the rise was dramatic, liver metastases or disseminated cancer in at least 97 per cent of the patients.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 31167699\nTitle: Unrecognized Value of Carcinoembryonic Antigen in Recurrent Rectal and Sigmoid Colon Cancer: Case Series.\nAuthors: Yavorkovsky LL, Kwong MS, Jhatakia S\nJournal: The Permanente journal\nPublication Date: 2019\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION: Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) surveillance is recommended in patients with colorectal cancer for detection of potentially resectable metastases. In patients with appropriate symptoms, a highly increased CEA concentration (> 5 times the upper limit of normal) is considered strongly suggestive of cancer. Despite the recognized value, the test is neither absolutely sensitive nor specific for recurrent cancer. Generally, a greater diagnostic value has been assigned to elevated CEA levels, most commonly greater than 5 ng/mL. Fluctuations within the established normal CEA range are not customarily analyzed. CASE PRESENTATIONS: We report here on 11 patients (8 women, 3 men) who, during the postoperative follow-up period, received a diagnosis of recurrent cancer despite their CEA levels exhibiting very subtle increases. Our cohort shared several similar characteristics such as a nonsmoking status, younger age (median, 52 years at initial diagnosis), and exclusive localization of the cancer to the rectosigmoid region. DISCUSSION: This important clinical observation may expand a prognostic value of CEA in a certain category of patients with colorectal cancer.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 7359922\nTitle: Serial CEA levels in colorectal carcinoma on adjuvant immuno(chemo)therapy--further follow-up. Modulation of adjuvant treatment.\nAuthors: Sopranzi N, Ponzini D, Di Paola M\nJournal: Journal of surgical oncology\nPublication Date: 1980\nAbstract: Serial plasma CEA levels have been studied preoperatively (testing A); one day after surgery (B); 10--15 days after surgery (C); 4 (D), 8 (E), 12 (F), 16--18 (G), and 22--24 (H) months after surgery in a series of 45 patients affected by colorectal carcinoma who started soon after surgery a protocol of adjuvant immuno(chemo)therapy with Levamisole and BCG. Postoperative follow-up was from one to 26 months, with 28 patients followed for at least one year. Fourteen patients had recurrences: two of these had false-negative CEA tests, three had persistent high CEA levels after surgery, nine had increasing levels 9--12 months before clinical recurrence; and nine of these 14 patients showed frankly pathologic preoperative plasma CEA levels. Six patients who did not have a recurrence but (both at clinical and instrumental evaluation) who had two consecutive high plasma CEA levels, were put on prophylactic polichemotherapy. The prognostic importance of CEA levels both pre- and postoperatively, the possibility of \"modulating\" postoperative adjuvant treatments on the basis of CEA levels, and the problem of unexplained fluctuations of plasma CEA levels with the putative metabolic linkages are discussed.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

chemotherapeutic agent. It was originally investigated for its antiviral effects, but it is now used as an anticancer therapy for various cancers.[A233135] Gemcitabine is a cytidine analog with two fluorine atoms replacing the hydroxyl on the ribose.[A233145] As a prodrug, gemcitabine is transformed into its active metabolites that work by replacing the building blocks of nucleic acids during DNA elongation, arresting tumour growth and promoting apoptosis of malignant cells.[L32960] The structure, metabolism, and mechanism of action of gemcitabine are similar to [cytarabine], but gemcitabine has a wider spectrum of antitumour activity.[A233140]\r\n\r\nGemcitabine is marketed as Gemzar and it is available as intravenous injection. It is approved by the FDA to treat advanced ovarian cancer in combination with [carboplatin], metastatic breast cancer in combination with [paclitaxel], non-small cell lung cancer in combination with [cisplatin], and pancreatic cancer as monotherapy.[L32950] It is also being investigated in other cancer and tumour types.\nOxaliplatin: Oxaliplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nPaclitaxel: Paclitaxel is a chemotherapeutic agent marketed under the brand name Taxol among others. Used as a treatment for various cancers, paclitaxel is a mitotic inhibitor that was first isolated in 1971 from the bark of the Pacific yew tree which contains endophytic fungi that synthesize paclitaxel. It is available as an intravenous solution for injection and the newer formulation contains albumin-bound paclitaxel marketed under the brand name Abraxane.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

chemotherapeutic agent. It was originally investigated for its antiviral effects, but it is now used as an anticancer therapy for various cancers.[A233135] Gemcitabine is a cytidine analog with two fluorine atoms replacing the hydroxyl on the ribose.[A233145] As a prodrug, gemcitabine is transformed into its active metabolites that work by replacing the building blocks of nucleic acids during DNA elongation, arresting tumour growth and promoting apoptosis of malignant cells.[L32960] The structure, metabolism, and mechanism of action of gemcitabine are similar to [cytarabine], but gemcitabine has a wider spectrum of antitumour activity.[A233140]\r\n\r\nGemcitabine is marketed as Gemzar and it is available as intravenous injection. It is approved by the FDA to treat advanced ovarian cancer in combination with [carboplatin], metastatic breast cancer in combination with [paclitaxel], non-small cell lung cancer in combination with [cisplatin], and pancreatic cancer as monotherapy.[L32950] It is also being investigated in other cancer and tumour types.\nOxaliplatin: Oxaliplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nPaclitaxel: Paclitaxel is a chemotherapeutic agent marketed under the brand name Taxol among others. Used as a treatment for various cancers, paclitaxel is a mitotic inhibitor that was first isolated in 1971 from the bark of the Pacific yew tree which contains endophytic fungi that synthesize paclitaxel. It is available as an intravenous solution for injection and the newer formulation contains albumin-bound paclitaxel marketed under the brand name Abraxane.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n",
