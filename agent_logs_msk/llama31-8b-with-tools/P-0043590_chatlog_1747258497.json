\n\n[DrugBank: Cisplatin: Cisplatin, cisplatinum or cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (CDDP) is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug used to treat various types of cancers, including sarcomas, some carcinomas (e.g. small cell lung cancer, and ovarian cancer), lymphomas and germ cell tumors. It was the first member of its class, which now also includes carboplatin and oxaliplatin.\nPemetrexed: Pemetrexed is a chemotherapy drug that is manufactured and marketed by Eli Lilly and Company under the brand name Alimta. It is indicated for use in combination with cisplatin for the treatment of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma whose disease is either unresectable or who are otherwise not candidates for curative surgery. Its use in non-small cell lung cancer has also been investigated. Pemetrexed was first approved by the FDA in February 4, 2004.[A253907]\nCarboplatin: Carboplatin is an organoplatinum antineoplastic alkylating agent used in the treatment of advanced ovarian carcinoma.[L32253] Early clinical studies of carboplatin were performed in 1982.[A230523] Carboplatin was developed as an analog of [cisplatin] with reduced nephrotoxicity and vomiting.[A230463,A230523]\r\n\r\nCarboplatin was granted FDA approval on 3 March 1989.[L32248]\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n",

The patient's cancer has been stable, with no progression noted in the past 6-8 months. However, the patient's performance status has changed, with an ECOG score of 0 at age 59.916 and an ECOG score of 1 at age 60.029.\n\nGiven this information, I would estimate that the likelihood of cancer progression within the next 6 months for the 61-year-old patient with lung adenocarcinoma is:\n\n[ANSWER: B)"
