Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0044903-T01-IM6\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0044903\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Colorectal Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Rectum\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Rectal Adenocarcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT468\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 444, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 40.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"READ\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

However, the neoadjuvant and surgical toxicity of this regimen was significant and was the primary reason for the low compliance with adjuvant systemic therapy.Due to the lack of an improvement in the pathologic complete response rate, the substantial associated toxicity, and the negative phase III trials of adjuvant bevacizumab in colon cancer, this regimen will not be pursued for further study. BACKGROUND: The addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy improves overall survival for metastatic colorectal cancer. We initiated a phase II trial to evaluate preoperative capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab with radiation therapy (RT) followed by surgery and postoperative 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin (FOLFOX), and bevacizumab for locally advanced rectal cancer. The purpose of this report is to describe the 5-year oncologic outcomes of this regimen. METHODS: In a phase II Simon two-stage design study, we evaluated preoperative treatment with capecitabine (825 mg/m(2) b.i.d. Monday-Friday), oxaliplatin (50 mg/m(2) weekly), bevacizumab (5 mg/kg on days 1, 15, and 29), and RT (50.4 Gy). Surgery was performed by 8 weeks after RT. Beginning 8-12 weeks after surgery, patients received FOLFOX plus bevacizumab (5 mg/kg) every 2 weeks for 12 cycles (oxaliplatin stopped after 9 cycles). The primary endpoint was a pathologic complete response (path-CR) rate of 30%. Fifty-seven patients with resectable T3/T4 rectal adenocarcinoma were enrolled between 2006 and 2010. RESULTS: Of 57 enrolled patients, 53 were eligible and included in the analysis. Forty-eight (91%) patients completed preoperative therapy, all of whom underwent curative surgical resection. Nine patients (17%) achieved path-CR. There were 29 worst grade 3 events, 8 worst grade 4 events, and 2 patient deaths, 1 of which was attributed to study therapy. Twenty-six patients (54%) began adjuvant chemotherapy. After a median follow-up period of 41 months, the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate for all patients was 80%. Only 2 patients experienced cancer recurrence: 1 distant (liver) and 1 loco-regional (pelvic lymph nodes), respectively. Both of these patients are still alive. The 5-year relapse-free survival rate was 81%. CONCLUSION: Despite the path-CR primary endpoint of this trial not being reached, the 5-year OS and recurrence-free survival rates were excellent. However, the neoadjuvant and surgical toxicity of this regimen was significant and was the primary reason for the low compliance with adjuvant systemic therapy. Because of the lack of an improvement in the path-CR rate, the substantial associated toxicity, and the negative phase III trials of adjuvant bevacizumab in colon cancer, this regimen will not be pursued for further study.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 21790235\nTitle: Adjuvant modified FOLFOX-4 in patients with stage III rectum adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Cihan S, Uncu D, Babacan NA\nJournal: Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP\nPublication Date: 2011\nAbstract: PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate efficacy and toxicity of a modified 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), folinic acid, oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX-4) regimen followed by infusional 5-FU concomitant with radiotherapy for curatively resected stage III rectum adenocarcinoma patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between April 2005 and July 2009, 55 operated stage III rectum cancer patients were evaluated retrospectively. mFOLFOX-4 regimen (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 1st day, folinic acid 200 mg/m2 1st day, 5-FU 400 mg/m2 iv bolus 1st day, 5-FU 1600 mg/m2 46 hours continuous infusion) was applied every 2 weeks. After four courses of mFOLFOX-4, 50.4 Gy (1.8 Gy in 28 fractions) radiotherapy with continuous 5-FU 200 mg/m(2)/day by infusion pump were given. On completion of chemoradiation four more mFOLFOX-4 courses were given. RESULTS: Median age of the patients was 54 years (range 23-73 years). Low anterior resection was performed in 37 (67.3%) and abdominoperineal resection in 16 (29.1%) . Ten (18.2%) patients were at stage IIIA, 24 (43.6%) at stage IIIB and 21 (38.2%) at stage IIIC. Planned chemotherapy cycles were completed in 92.7% of patients. Grades 3-4 toxicity included neutropenia (9.1%), febrile neutropenia (3.6%), anemia (3.6%), diarrhea (21.8%), neuropathy (9.1%), renal toxicity (3.6%), hepatotoxicity (5.5%). Median follow-up time was 30 (9-57) months. Local recurrence and distant metastasis was observed in 3 (5.5%) and 10 (18.2%) patients, respectively. Ten (18.2%) patients died during follow-up. Three years disease free survival and overall survival were 67.5% and 77.3%, respectively. CONCLUSION: mFOLFOX-4 following chemoradiotherapy with continuous 5- FU infusion is an effective and well tolerated adjuvant treatment for stage III rectal carcinoma patients.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 27209506\nTitle: Quality of Life Outcomes From a Phase 2 Trial of Short-Course Radiation Therapy Followed by FOLFOX Chemotherapy as Preoperative Treatment for Rectal Cancer.\nAuthors: Khwaja SS, Roy A, Markovina S\nJournal: International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics\nPublication Date: 2016 Aug 1\nAbstract: PURPOSE: A prospective phase 2 trial of short-course (SC) radiation therapy (RT) with 25 Gy over 5 fractions, followed by 4 cycles of 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and leucovorin (mFOLFOX6) before surgery was recently completed at our institution. We present here the patient-reported quality of life (QOL) outcomes from this trial. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighty patients with cT3/T4, any N, any M rectal adenocarcinoma planned for resection were enrolled between 2009 and 2012. The QOL data were obtained prospectively using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Colon (FACT-C) questionnaire before RT, before surgery, and 1 year after surgery. The previously validated minimally importance difference (MID) method was used to measure clinically significant QOL changes in FACT-C scores for each patient across time points. We examined the role of ostomy on QOL. We also compared QOL with disease outcomes and physician-reported toxicity. RESULTS: The FACT-C questionnaire was completed by 97% of patients before RT, 85% immediately before surgery, and 62% 1 year after surgery. There was no statistically significant change in mean FACT-C scores from before treatment to after treatment. The majority of patients had either no change or an increase in QOL 1 year after treatment using the MID method. There were significant changes in QOL between patients with ostomy versus no ostomy 1 year after treatment for functional well-being (FWB) (14.81 vs 20.52, P=.018) and the colorectal cancer subscale (CCS) using the MID method (P=.004). Patients without ostomy reported stable changes in bowel control 1 year after surgery. There was no statistically significant correlation between QOL and disease recurrence, pathologic complete response, pathologic T stage downstaging, or acute/late toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: SC-RT and sequential mFOLFOX6 as preoperative therapy for rectal cancer results in stable patient-reported QOL outcomes 1 year after treatment. These findings in conjunction with previously reported oncologic outcomes support further evaluation of this regimen in a phase 3 setting.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

This report evaluates the prognostic factors affecting local recurrence and 5-year survival. This is a retrospective study of 214 patients with primary rectal adenocarcinoma treated from January 1986 to December 1994. A PRT dosage of 45 Gy in 20 fractions was administered to patients with clinically tethered or fixed tumors, and 4 to 8 weeks later surgery was performed (group I). Patients with clinically mobile tumors were treated by surgery alone (group II). There were 130 men and 84 women. The median age was 58 years (range 19-85 years). There were 111 patients in group I: 7 patients had no microscopic residual tumor, 80 had Dukes' A and B, and 24 had Dukes' C. There were 103 patients in group II: 70 patients were classified as Dukes' A and B and 33 as Dukes' C. The mean follow-up of the entire cohort was 62 months (range 2-132 months). Local recurrence was seen in 17% of patients in group I and 35% in group II (p = 0.002). Distant recurrence in patients with metastatic lymph nodes was seen in 79% of group I and in 34% of group II (p = 0.001). The favorable prognostic factors for local control were the administration of PRT and well differentiated cancer. The favorable prognostic factors for survival were age < 50 years and the absence of lymph node metastasis. The administration of PRT diminishes the risk of local recurrence. The presence of metastatic lymph nodes in the postirradiated specimen is an ominous prognostic factor for survival. Therefore such patients should be considered for adjuvant chemotherapy.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 28420585\nTitle: Adjuvant Chemotherapy Is Associated With Improved Overall Survival in Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer After Achievement of a Pathologic Complete Response to Chemoradiation.\nAuthors: Shahab D, Gabriel E, Attwood K\nJournal: Clinical colorectal cancer\nPublication Date: 2017 Dec\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: In locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma, 15% to 20% of patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation (nCRT) achieve a pathologic complete response (pCR). The benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy is controversial in rectal cancer. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of clinical risk factors and adjuvant chemotherapy usage on the outcomes of the pCR patient population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study using the National Cancer Data Base from 2006 to 2013. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). The association between OS and patient characteristics (demographics, tumor variables, and treatment) was examined using multivariable Cox regression modelling. RESULTS: A total of 2891 patients were identified who had achieved a pCR. Of these 2891 patients, 2102 received nCRT and 789 received nCRT followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. The median follow-up duration was 43.2 months. The factors significantly associated with OS included age (P < .001), gender (P = .011), Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score (P < .001), grade (P = .029), clinical T stage (P = .030), carcinoembryonic antigen negativity (P = .002), and receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy (P < .001). Nodal status was not significantly associated with survival. The 5-year OS rate was 94% in the nCRT plus adjuvant group compared with 84% in the nCRT-alone group. Adjuvant chemotherapy was more likely to be given to younger patients (aged < 60 years), higher grade, lower Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score, elevated carcinoembryonic antigen level, higher clinical T stage, and higher clinical N stage. CONCLUSION: Our findings showed a significant improvement in OS for patients who received nCRT plus adjuvant chemotherapy compared with those who received nCRT alone. The nCRT plus adjuvant patients were more likely to be younger, have a lower comorbidity score, have clinical >/= T3 disease, and have clinical node-positive disease. Thus, a selection bias could have been present. Nonetheless, even in the setting of already excellent outcomes, for patients with locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma who achieve a pCR, the additional benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy should be weighed against the potential for toxicity.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 38901994\nTitle: [Retrospective study of role of neoadjuvant rectal scores in evaluating the 10-year disease-free survival of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery].\nAuthors: Zhang WL, Zhou C, Wang WF\nJournal: Zhonghua wei chang wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of gastrointestinal surgery\nPublication Date: 2024 Jun 25\nAbstract: Objective: To investigate the correlation between the neoadjuvant rectal (NAR) score and long-term survival in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who have undergone neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Methods: Clinical and pathological data of 487 patients diagnosed with rectal adenocarcinoma from October 2004 to April 2014 at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center who had received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy were retrospectively analyzed and the impact of NAR score on prognosis studied. Disease-free-survival (DFS) was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and survivals compared using the log-rank test. Cox models were used for univariate and multivariate analyses. Receiver operating characteristic curves were utilized to evaluate the predictive capability of NAR and tumor regression grade scores for the risk of 10-year postoperative recurrence and metastasis. The Delong test was employed to compare the diagnostic performance of the two scores. Results: Of the 487 patients included in the study, 166 were men (34.1%). The median age was 56 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 46-63). All patients completed adequate preoperative chemoradiotherapy and underwent R0 resection.The median interval between the end of chemoradiotherapy and surgery was 51 days (IQR: 44-58). Post-chemoradiotherapy downstaging occurred in 329 patients (67.6%). Tumor regression grades (TRGs) were 1-2 in 246 patients (50.5%) and 3-4 in 241 patients (49.5%). A total of 394 patients (80.9%) received postoperative chemotherapy. NAR scores were <8 in 182 patients (37.4%), 8-16 in 180 (37.0%), and >16 in 125 (25.6%). The median follow-up time was 111.5 months (IQR: 70.7-133.7 months). One hundred and thirteen patients died of rectal cancer, among whom 13 patients developed local recurrence, 88 patients developed distant metastasis, and 12 patients had unknown recurrence patterns. The 10-year DFS and overall survival rate of f the whole group were 68.9% and 71.5% respectively. The 10-year DFS rates for patients with NAR scores <8, 8-16, and >16 were 85.1%, 80.5%, and 66.4%, respectively (P<0.001). Multivariate analyses revealed that the Dixon operation (HR=0.606, 95%CI: 0.408-0.902, P=0.014), and >16 (HR=2.569, 95%CI: 1.559-4.233, P<0.001) were independent predictors of the 10-year DFS of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (P<0.05 for all). In the entire patient cohort, the AUC of the receiver operating characteristic curve for NAR score predicting 10-year recurrence and metastasis was 0.67 (95%CI: 0.62-0.72), whereas the AUC for TRG score was 0.54 (95%CI: 0.49-0.60). The two scores differed significantly in accuracy (Z=-4.06, P<0.001), the NAR score being a significantly better predictor of risk of 10-year recurrence and metastasis than the TRG score. Conclusion: The NAR score is a reliable predictor of 10-year DFS in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who have undergone neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by curative surgery.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
