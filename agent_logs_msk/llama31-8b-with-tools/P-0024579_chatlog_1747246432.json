The antibody is an IgG1 kappa immunoglobulin containing murine light and heavy-chain variable region sequences and human constant region sequences [A40017], [FDA label]. It was originally approved by the U.S. FDA in 1997 as a single agent to treat patients with B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) [L4811], however, has now been approved for a variety of conditions [FDA label]. On November 28, 2018, the US FDA approved _Truxima_, the first biosimilar to Rituxan (Rituximab) [L4808].\nCyclophosphamide: Precursor of an alkylating nitrogen mustard antineoplastic and immunosuppressive agent that must be activated in the liver to form the active aldophosphamide. It has been used in the treatment of lymphoma and leukemia. Its side effect, alopecia, has been used for defleecing sheep. Cyclophosphamide may also cause sterility, birth defects, mutations, and cancer.\nVincristine: Vincristine is an antitumor vinca alkaloid isolated from Vinca Rosea. It is marketed under several brand names, many of which have different formulations such as Marqibo (liposomal injection) and Vincasar. Vincristine is indicated for the treatment of acute leukaemia, malignant lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, acute erythraemia, and acute panmyelosis. vincristine sulfate is often chosen as part of polychemotherapy because of lack of significant bone\u2013marrow suppression (at recommended doses) and of unique clinical toxicity (neuropathy).\nDoxorubicin: Doxorubicin is a cytotoxic anthracycline antibiotic isolated from cultures of Streptomyces peucetius var. caesius along side with daunorubicin, another cytotoxic agent, in 1970.[A1575,A257709,A257614] Although they both have aglyconic and sugar moieties, doxorubicin's side chain terminates with a primary alcohol group compared to the methyl group of daunorubicin.[A257709] Although its detailed molecular mechanisms have yet to be understood, doxorubicin is generally thought to exert its effect through DNA intercalation, which eventually leads to DNA damage and the generation of reactive oxygen species.[A257614] Thanks to its efficacy and broad effect, doxorubicin was approved by the FDA in 1974 to treat a variety of cancer, including but not limited to breast, lung, gastric, ovarian, thyroid, non-Hodgkin\u2019s and Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, multiple myeloma, sarcoma, and pediatric cancers.[A1573,A257614,L45231] However, one of the major side effects of doxorubicin is cardiotoxicity, which excludes patients with poor heart function and requires treatment termination once the maximally tolerated cumulative dose is reached.[A257719]\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

Whether surgery offered the same benefit for elderly patients as that for younger cohort and which factors affected long-term outcome of elderly population remained unclear. AIMS: This study aims to evaluate long-term prognosis of elderly PDAC patients (>/=70 years old) after surgery and to investigate potential prognostic factors. METHODS: This retrospective study included PDAC patients receiving radical resection from January 2012 to July 2019 in Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University. Patients were divided into young (<70) and old groups (>/=70). Propensity score matching (PSM) was conducted to eliminate the confounding factors. We investigated potential prognostic factors via Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier estimator. Nomogram model and forest plot were constructed to illustrate the prognostic value of age. RESULTS: A total of 552 PDAC patients who received radical resection were included in this research. Elderly patients showed poorer nutritional status and were less likely to received adjuvant treatment. After matching, although age [hazard ratio (HR)=1.025, 95%CI 0.997-1.054; p=0.083] was not statistically significant in the multivariate cox regression analysis, further survival analysis showed that patients in the old group had poorer overall survival (OS) when compared with young group (p=0.039). Furthermore, reception of adjuvant chemotherapy (HR=0.411, 95%CI 0.201-0.837; p=0.014) was the only independent prognostic factor among elderly patients and could significantly improve OS. Subgroup analysis indicated that age had better prognostic value in PDAC patients with good preoperative nutritional status and relative low tumor burden. Finally, a prognostic prediction model contained age, reception of adjuvant chemotherapy, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th T and N stage was constructed and presented in nomogram, whose Harrell's concordance index was 0.7478 (95%CI, 0.6960-0.7996). The calibration curves at 1 and 3 years indicated an optimal conformity between actual and nomogram-predicted survival probability in the PDAC patient who received surgery. CONCLUSION: The elderly PDAC patients were associated with worse OS survival after radical resection, and the noticeable negative effect of age was observed among PDAC patients with better preoperative nutritional status and less aggressive tumor biology. Adjuvant chemotherapy was essential to improve survival outcome of elderly PDAC patients following radical resection.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 24854617\nTitle: Chemotherapy for advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma in elderly patients (>/=70 years of age): a retrospective cohort study at the National Center for Tumor Diseases Heidelberg.\nAuthors: Berger AK, Abel U, Komander C\nJournal: Pancreatology : official journal of the International Association of Pancreatology (IAP) ... [et al.]\nPublication Date: 2014 May-Jun\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is mainly a disease of the elderly population, but clinical trials do not reflect this age distribution. Data on treatment strategies and outcome of older patients are limited. The aim of our study was to analyze safety and outcome in elderly patients with advanced pancreatic cancer treated with palliative chemotherapy at the outpatient clinic of the National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) at Heidelberg University Hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 53 patients >/=70 years using a prospectively maintained database. Requirements were (1) histologically proven diagnosis of ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma, (2) age >/=70 at time of diagnosis of advanced disease, and (3) measurable advanced disease. RESULTS: The median age was 73 years. 81% of the patients received a gemcitabine-based first-line therapy. Median overall survival was 6.7 months. Survival differed significantly between patient groups with low (</=1) and high (>/=2) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (7.8 vs. 3.9 months, p = 0.002). 30.2% of the patients developed side effects resulting in dosage reductions. 39.6% of the patients received second-line treatment. Residual survival after disease progression was significantly longer for second-line treatment compared to best supportive care (151 vs. 39 days, p = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our older patients did not have an inferior outcome compared to the reported trial populations that included younger patients. Thus, palliative chemotherapy should be considered independently from chronological age, but the performance status should be carefully noticed. Second-line therapy should be considered for patients in good performance status after first progression.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 32011535\nTitle: The Influence of Patients' Age on the Outcome of Treatment for Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Malik AK, Lamarca A, Siriwardena AK\nJournal: Pancreas\nPublication Date: 2020 Feb\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine the impact of age on curative management and outcomes of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. METHODS: Patients who underwent resection for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma at 2 units were retrospectively reviewed (between 2005 and 2017) and stratified by age (older patients >/=70 years). Regression analysis was used to explore factors impacting administration of adjuvant chemotherapy and survival. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate overall survival (time from surgery to death). Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. RESULTS: From 2005 to 2014, 222 patients were identified (<70 years, n = 128; >/=70 years, n = 94). Elderly patients were less likely to receive adjuvant chemotherapy compared with younger patients (odds ratio, 0.57, P = 0.041). Tumor stage, margin, and year of surgery (post-2011 vs pre-2011) were not predictors for chemotherapy receipt (P > 0.05). Frailty was the commonest reason (36.8%) to decline chemotherapy in elderly patients. In patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, completion rates (P = 0.32) and overall survival (24 months vs 30 months, P = 0.50) were no different. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients demonstrate similar outcomes to younger yet are less likely to commence chemotherapy because of frailty. Holistic preoperative assessment may improve selection for curative treatment.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

METHODS: Fifty patients with suspected pancreatic cancer presenting consecutively at the Kindai University Hospital between January 2018 and January 2019 were enrolled. Cancerous tissues from EUS-FNB were obtained from each tumor and subjected to histological examination and mutational analysis. The primary endpoint was the collection rate of EUS-FNB specimens suitable for comprehensive cancer panels using deep sequencing. Clinical history and genetic variations between the disease control and progressive disease groups of patients on chemotherapy were evaluated as secondary endpoints. RESULTS: The collection rate of EUS-FNB specimens suitable for comprehensive cancer panels using deep sequencing was 93.6%. The cancer panel was sequenced for 25 patients with pancreatic cancer treated initially with systemic chemotherapy. Mutation in p53 and Smad4 were positively and negatively associated, respectively, with disease control at the initial evaluation. The median time to progression in 15 patients with p53 and without Smad4 mutations was 182.0 days; whereas, it was 92.5 days in other 10 patients; this difference was significant (p = 0.020). CONCLUSIONS: Tissue samples from EUS-FNB were suitable for mutational analysis. Pancreatic cancers with p53 and without Smad4 mutations responded better to chemotherapy and had a better prognosis than those others.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 27256393\nTitle: Infiltrating immune cells and gene mutations in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Wang WQ, Liu L, Xu HX\nJournal: The British journal of surgery\nPublication Date: 2016 Aug\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the immune profile within the microenvironment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and to investigate the prognostic value of intratumoral infiltrating immune/inflammatory cells (IICs) in patients after surgery. METHODS: Eighteen phenotypic markers representing 11 types of IIC and the protein products of genes TP53, CDKN2A/p16 and SMAD4/DPC4 were assessed by immunohistochemistry of specimens from patients with pancreatic cancer. The expression of IICs and the mutational status of the genes were correlated with tumour recurrence and survival, and results were validated in an independent cohort. RESULTS: CD15+ neutrophils, CD20+ B cells and CD206+ tumour-associated macrophages were seen frequently in tumours, and their presence was associated with reduced survival in a cohort of 79 patients. Expression of CD4+ T helper cells, CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes and CD117+ mast cells was associated with a favourable prognosis. A weighted Cox regression recurrence-predictive model was constructed that showed good correlation of IICs and gene mutations. A combination of CD15, CD206, CD117 and Smad4 expression was independently associated with overall (hazard ratio (HR) 3.63, 95 per cent c.i. 2.18 to 6.04; P < 0.001) and recurrence-free (HR 2.93, 1.81 to 4.75; P < 0.001) survival. These findings were validated in an independent cohort (151 patients) and in 54 tissue samples obtained by preoperative endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration. CONCLUSION: PDAC has a unique immunosuppressive phenotype that is associated with characteristic gene mutations, disease recurrence and survival after pancreatectomy. Surgical relevance The immune microenvironment plays a critical role in the development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). PDAC is associated with mutations in major driver genes, including KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A/p16 and SMAD4/DPC4. This study shows that the microenvironment of PDAC has a unique immunosuppressive phenotype, which may be driven by oncogene mutations. Patients with PDAC with a highly immunosuppressive profile tended to have poor postoperative survival. A model including three intratumoral infiltrating immune markers (CD15+, CD206+ and CD117+) and a SMAD4 mutation can be used to predict recurrence and survival in patients after surgery for PDAC.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 29922827\nTitle: Association Between Inherited Germline Mutations in Cancer Predisposition Genes and Risk of Pancreatic Cancer.\nAuthors: Hu C, Hart SN, Polley EC\nJournal: JAMA\nPublication Date: 2018 Jun 19\nAbstract: IMPORTANCE: Individuals genetically predisposed to pancreatic cancer may benefit from early detection. Genes that predispose to pancreatic cancer and the risks of pancreatic cancer associated with mutations in these genes are not well defined. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether inherited germline mutations in cancer predisposition genes are associated with increased risks of pancreatic cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Case-control analysis to identify pancreatic cancer predisposition genes; longitudinal analysis of patients with pancreatic cancer for prognosis. The study included 3030 adults diagnosed as having pancreatic cancer and enrolled in a Mayo Clinic registry between October 12, 2000, and March 31, 2016, with last follow-up on June 22, 2017. Reference controls were 123\u202f136 individuals with exome sequence data in the public Genome Aggregation Database and 53\u202f105 in the Exome Aggregation Consortium database. EXPOSURES: Individuals were classified based on carrying a deleterious mutation in cancer predisposition genes and having a personal or family history of cancer. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Germline mutations in coding regions of 21 cancer predisposition genes were identified by sequencing of products from a custom multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based panel; associations of genes with pancreatic cancer were assessed by comparing frequency of mutations in genes of pancreatic cancer patients with those of reference controls. RESULTS: Comparing 3030 case patients with pancreatic cancer (43.2% female; 95.6% non-Hispanic white; mean age at diagnosis, 65.3 [SD, 10.7] years) with reference controls, significant associations were observed between pancreatic cancer and mutations in CDKN2A (0.3% of cases and 0.02% of controls; odds ratio [OR], 12.33; 95% CI, 5.43-25.61); TP53 (0.2% of cases and 0.02% of controls; OR, 6.70; 95% CI, 2.52-14.95); MLH1 (0.13% of cases and 0.02% of controls; OR, 6.66; 95% CI, 1.94-17.53); BRCA2 (1.9% of cases and 0.3% of controls; OR, 6.20; 95% CI, 4.62-8.17); ATM (2.3% of cases and 0.37% of controls; OR, 5.71; 95% CI, 4.38-7.33); and BRCA1 (0.6% of cases and 0.2% of controls; OR, 2.58; 95% CI, 1.54-4.05). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this case-control study, mutations in 6 genes associated with pancreatic cancer were found in 5.5% of all pancreatic cancer patients, including 7.9% of patients with a family history of pancreatic cancer and 5.2% of patients without a family history of pancreatic cancer. Further research is needed for replication in other populations.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Whether surgery offered the same benefit for elderly patients as that for younger cohort and which factors affected long-term outcome of elderly population remained unclear. AIMS: This study aims to evaluate long-term prognosis of elderly PDAC patients (>/=70 years old) after surgery and to investigate potential prognostic factors. METHODS: This retrospective study included PDAC patients receiving radical resection from January 2012 to July 2019 in Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University. Patients were divided into young (<70) and old groups (>/=70). Propensity score matching (PSM) was conducted to eliminate the confounding factors. We investigated potential prognostic factors via Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier estimator. Nomogram model and forest plot were constructed to illustrate the prognostic value of age. RESULTS: A total of 552 PDAC patients who received radical resection were included in this research. Elderly patients showed poorer nutritional status and were less likely to received adjuvant treatment. After matching, although age [hazard ratio (HR)=1.025, 95%CI 0.997-1.054; p=0.083] was not statistically significant in the multivariate cox regression analysis, further survival analysis showed that patients in the old group had poorer overall survival (OS) when compared with young group (p=0.039). Furthermore, reception of adjuvant chemotherapy (HR=0.411, 95%CI 0.201-0.837; p=0.014) was the only independent prognostic factor among elderly patients and could significantly improve OS. Subgroup analysis indicated that age had better prognostic value in PDAC patients with good preoperative nutritional status and relative low tumor burden. Finally, a prognostic prediction model contained age, reception of adjuvant chemotherapy, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th T and N stage was constructed and presented in nomogram, whose Harrell's concordance index was 0.7478 (95%CI, 0.6960-0.7996). The calibration curves at 1 and 3 years indicated an optimal conformity between actual and nomogram-predicted survival probability in the PDAC patient who received surgery. CONCLUSION: The elderly PDAC patients were associated with worse OS survival after radical resection, and the noticeable negative effect of age was observed among PDAC patients with better preoperative nutritional status and less aggressive tumor biology. Adjuvant chemotherapy was essential to improve survival outcome of elderly PDAC patients following radical resection.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 24854617\nTitle: Chemotherapy for advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma in elderly patients (>/=70 years of age): a retrospective cohort study at the National Center for Tumor Diseases Heidelberg.\nAuthors: Berger AK, Abel U, Komander C\nJournal: Pancreatology : official journal of the International Association of Pancreatology (IAP) ... [et al.]\nPublication Date: 2014 May-Jun\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is mainly a disease of the elderly population, but clinical trials do not reflect this age distribution. Data on treatment strategies and outcome of older patients are limited. The aim of our study was to analyze safety and outcome in elderly patients with advanced pancreatic cancer treated with palliative chemotherapy at the outpatient clinic of the National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) at Heidelberg University Hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 53 patients >/=70 years using a prospectively maintained database. Requirements were (1) histologically proven diagnosis of ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma, (2) age >/=70 at time of diagnosis of advanced disease, and (3) measurable advanced disease. RESULTS: The median age was 73 years. 81% of the patients received a gemcitabine-based first-line therapy. Median overall survival was 6.7 months. Survival differed significantly between patient groups with low (</=1) and high (>/=2) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (7.8 vs. 3.9 months, p = 0.002). 30.2% of the patients developed side effects resulting in dosage reductions. 39.6% of the patients received second-line treatment. Residual survival after disease progression was significantly longer for second-line treatment compared to best supportive care (151 vs. 39 days, p = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our older patients did not have an inferior outcome compared to the reported trial populations that included younger patients. Thus, palliative chemotherapy should be considered independently from chronological age, but the performance status should be carefully noticed. Second-line therapy should be considered for patients in good performance status after first progression.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 32011535\nTitle: The Influence of Patients' Age on the Outcome of Treatment for Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Malik AK, Lamarca A, Siriwardena AK\nJournal: Pancreas\nPublication Date: 2020 Feb\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine the impact of age on curative management and outcomes of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. METHODS: Patients who underwent resection for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma at 2 units were retrospectively reviewed (between 2005 and 2017) and stratified by age (older patients >/=70 years). Regression analysis was used to explore factors impacting administration of adjuvant chemotherapy and survival. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate overall survival (time from surgery to death). Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. RESULTS: From 2005 to 2014, 222 patients were identified (<70 years, n = 128; >/=70 years, n = 94). Elderly patients were less likely to receive adjuvant chemotherapy compared with younger patients (odds ratio, 0.57, P = 0.041). Tumor stage, margin, and year of surgery (post-2011 vs pre-2011) were not predictors for chemotherapy receipt (P > 0.05). Frailty was the commonest reason (36.8%) to decline chemotherapy in elderly patients. In patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, completion rates (P = 0.32) and overall survival (24 months vs 30 months, P = 0.50) were no different. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients demonstrate similar outcomes to younger yet are less likely to commence chemotherapy because of frailty. Holistic preoperative assessment may improve selection for curative treatment.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
