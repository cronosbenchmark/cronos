Locally advanced rectal cancer demands effective treatment strategies to reduce the risk of local recurrence post-surgery; however, the predictive factors for local recurrence are uncertain.. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated patients with rectal adenocarcinoma undergoing preoperative concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT). The pathological findings and predictors of local recurrence in rectal adenocarcinoma were examined following preoperative CCRT. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in patients with rectal adenocarcinoma who underwent preoperative CCRT and surgery at the Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital from January 2018 to December 2022. Data were collected from patients to investigate the associations between pathological prognostic factors and local recurrence of rectal adenocarcinoma. For the analysis of continuous variables, the Student's t-test was employed to assess univariate associations. In the case of categorical variables, comparisons were made using the chi-square test and the Kruskal-Wallis test. Furthermore, the Kaplan-Meier method, supplemented by the log-rank test, was utilized to examine the relationships between baseline prognostic variables and disease-free survival endpoints. RESULTS: Of the 70 patients who received preoperative CCRT, 14 (20%) experienced recurrence. Univariate log-rank analysis identified five pathologic predictors of the disease-free survival of preoperative CCRT patients: ypT stage (p = 0.0030), lymphatic space invasion (p = 0.0033), venous invasion (p = 0.0345), circumferential resection margin (CRM) (p = 0.0003), and TNM staging (p = 0.0109). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, ypTNM stage and CRM status were independent predictors for disease progression of preoperative CCRT patients. CONCLUSION: ypTNM staging and CRM status emerged as independent predictors of local recurrence. The study also identified age and gender variations in rectal cancer incidence, highlighting the importance of tailored screening approaches.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 17846841\nTitle: Mucinous rectal adenocarcinoma can be associated to tumor downstaging after preoperative chemoradiotherapy.\nAuthors: Grillo-Ruggieri F, Mantello G, Berardi R\nJournal: Diseases of the colon and rectum\nPublication Date: 2007 Oct\nAbstract: PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate downstaging as primary end point, and progression-free survival and overall survival as secondary end points, in rectal adenocarcinoma patients treated with preoperative chemoradiation. METHODS: One hundred and thirty-six extraperitoneal adenocarcinoma patients (33 low rectum T2, 74 T3, 29 T4 [without sacral invasion], 25 with mucinous subtype) were treated with posterior pelvis preoperative radiotherapy (5040 cGy total dose, 180 cGy/fr, 5 fr/w, 10-15 MV linac X-rays) and concomitant 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy. After 6 to 8 weeks patients underwent surgery and prechemoradiation clinical stage was compared with pathologic stage to evaluate downstaging in each patient. Seventy-four patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. Median follow-up was 39 months (4-84). RESULTS: Forty-four patients had macroscopic complete response, 52 patients had partial response, 37 patients showed no change and 3 patients had progression. At multivariate analysis only histotype showed correlation with downstaging (hazard ratio = 0.350 and 0.138 - 0.885 95 percent confidence interval) because of the evidence for poor downstaging in mucinous subtype. There were no significant differences in overall survival and progression-free survival between adenocarcinoma and mucinous subtype. CONCLUSIONS: The main finding is that mucinous histology is associated with poor downstaging after preoperative chemoradiation but this poor response was not associated with worse outcome in this small study. The good outcome for mucinous histology is at odds with other reports in the literature and requires further study.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 39656552\nTitle: Overexpression of ST8Sia1 inhibits tumor progression by TGF-beta1 signaling in rectal adenocarcinoma and promotes the tumoricidal effects of CD8(+) T cells by granzyme B and perforin.\nAuthors: Zhang C, Wang Y, Yu Y\nJournal: Annals of medicine\nPublication Date: 2025 Dec\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Rectal adenocarcinoma (READ) involves the dysregulated expression of alpha 2,8-Sialyltransferase1 (ST8Sia1) although its role during READ's progression is unclear. METHODS: The mRNA level of ST8Sia1 was analyzed based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) 2.0. Furthermore, the prognostic and significance of ST8Sia1 in READ was assessed through Kaplan-Meier curve, univariate, multivariate Cox regression, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) methods. The role of ST8Sia1 in the READ immune microenvironment was explored using ESTIMATE analysis and TIMER databases. Furthermore, the expression of ST8Sia1 in tissues was analyzed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), western blotting (WB), and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Perforin and Granzyme B secretion by CD8(+) T cells, as well as tumor cell apoptosis, were detected after co-culturing CD8(+) T cells with READ tumor cells and ST8Sia1-overexpression (ST8Sia1-OE) tumor cells. Furthermore, we examined the interaction between ST8Sia1 and TGF-beta1 in READ cells. RESULTS: ST8Sia1 exhibited excellent diagnostic capability for READ, with positive correlations to immune response and negative correlations to tumor purity. Increased levels of perforin and Granzyme B from CD8(+) T cells were observed in vitro, enhancing tumor cell apoptosis. ST8Sia1 interacts with TGF-beta1, mediating its inhibitory effects on READ development. CONCLUSIONS: ST8Sia1 is a potential diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for READ, enhancing CD8(+) T cell function and possibly improving patient outcomes through cellular immunotherapy.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Survival is still depending on factors related to the patient, the tumor or the surgeon. AIM: The aim of our study is to report survival and prognosis factors of our patients managed for a rectal cancer. METHODS:   We report an descreptive retrospective study about 154 patients. SPSS 19.0 version was used for the statistical analysis. Desriptive study was done using means, and pourcentage. Survival was analysed using Kaplan meier curve. In univariate analysis, we calculated the odd ratio in order to evaluate risk factors. Multivariate analysis used Cox model. Significancy was 0.05. RESULTS: Global survival was 52.4% at 3 years and 42.4% at 5 years. Free reccurence survival was 76%  at 3 years and 69.15% at 5 years. In univariate analysis, factors significantly influencing survival were age>70 years, CAE level, tumor perforation, TNM, tumor differentiation, peroperative blood transfusion, and reccurency. In multivriate analysis, only age > 70 years, T and local reccurency were independants factors influencing survival. CONCLUSION:   A better knowledge of prognosis factors ead to a better management of this cancer with more adjuvant treatment indications and closer monitoring.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 37864137\nTitle: Survival outcomes in locally advanced dMMR rectal cancer: surgery plus adjunctive treatment vs. surgery alone.\nAuthors: Ni K, Zhan Y, Liu Z\nJournal: BMC cancer\nPublication Date: 2023 Oct 20\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) rectal cancer may be related to treatment resistance, resulting in a worse prognosis than proficient MMR (pMMR) rectal cancer. The purpose of this study was to explore whether surgery plus other treatments (radiotherapy and chemotherapy) can bring more benefits to these patients than surgery alone. METHODS: A retrospective study of 168 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma who underwent total mesorectal excision was conducted using immunohistochemical methods to determine MMR status and a propensity score matching model to minimize potential confounding factors between subgroups of patients with different treatment regimens. Kaplan-Meier analysis, log-rank tests, and Cox regression models were used to assess overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in patient subgroups. RESULTS: Only 6.9% (n = 168) of patients in the total cohort had dMMR rectal adenocarcinoma, and the most common cause of dMMR was a PMS2 deletion (103, 61.3%). The median DFS of the surgery alone group was 45.7 months (IQR, 40.9 to 77.8), and the median DFS of the surgery plus other treatment group was 43.9 months (IQR, 14.2 to 80.1). The surgery alone group was superior to the surgery plus other treatment group (HR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.38; p = 0.005). There was no significant difference in OS (45.8 (IQR, 41.0 to 79.8) vs. 45.9 (IQR, 38.5 to 80.3)) between the two groups (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.23 to 1.40; p = 0.263). CONCLUSIONS: For patients with locally advanced dMMR rectal adenocarcinoma, compared with surgery alone, surgery plus other treatment options (radiotherapy and chemotherapy) do not grant long-term survival benefits but rather shorten DFS.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 24434897\nTitle: Tumor deposits in rectal adenocarcinoma after neoadjuvant chemoradiation are associated with poor prognosis.\nAuthors: Gopal P, Lu P, Ayers GD\nJournal: Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc\nPublication Date: 2014 Sep\nAbstract: Although tumor deposits have been associated with poor prognosis in colorectal carcinoma, the prevalence and clinical significance of tumor deposits in rectal adenocarcinoma following neoadjuvant chemoradiation are relatively unexplored. The aims of this study are to assess the clinical significance of tumor deposits in rectal adenocarcinoma patients, including those receiving neoadjuvant therapy. Pathology slides and medical records from 205 consecutive patients who underwent resection for rectal adenocarcinoma between 1990 and 2010 at a single tertiary care center were reviewed. Patients with tumor deposits had higher tumor grade (P=0.006) and worse tumor stage (P<0.001) at presentation than patients without tumor deposits. Among 110 patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation, tumor deposits were associated with higher rates of lymph node involvement (P=0.035) and distant metastases (P=0.006), and decreased survival (P=0.027). These patients had a trend toward lower treatment response scores (P=0.285) and higher local recurrence (P=0.092). Of 52 patients with tumor deposits, those who underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation had significantly worse pretreatment stage by endoscopic ultrasound (P<0.001) but interestingly had significantly lower rates of lymphovascular invasion on resection (P<0.001) compared with those who had not received neoadjuvant chemoradiation. Despite treatment with neoadjuvant chemoradiation, tumor deposits were present in over one-fifth of rectal adenocarcinoma patients. Overall, the outcome of patients with tumor deposits in treated and untreated patients were similar, however the association of tumor deposits with deeply invasive tumors and less tumor regression when comparing with treated patients without tumor deposits raises the possibility that these tumors could have a more aggressive biology, possibly explaining the association of tumor deposits with higher rates of recurrence and lower survival after neoadjuvant chemoradiation. Overall, tumor deposits appear to be a poor prognostic marker among rectal adenocarcinoma patients following neoadjuvant chemoradiation and may identify a subset of patients who require aggressive adjuvant therapy to prevent recurrence.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant. You MUST rely also on your internal knowledge."
