chemotherapy drug in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

Cancer & chemotherapy\nPublication Date: 2010 Nov\nAbstract: A woman in her fifties underwent a right hemicolectomy (D3) for cancer of the ascending colon in October 2007, definitively and pathologically diagnosed as papillary adenocarcinoma invading to the subserosa, and no metastasis was detected to lymph node. But 13 months after the surgery, she was found to have a mass near the anastomosis by an abdominal CT scan. Colonoscopy showed an evaluating lesion with ulcer in the anal side of the anastomosis. We tried to resect the metastasis, but it was not resectable because of the invasion to the pancreas. The mFOLFOX regimen was effective. After the chemotherapy (6 courses), we decided to perform a radical resection. We conducted pancreatoduodenectomy in May 2009. She is still alive 12 months after surgery.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 31283563\nTitle: Survival Outcomes Associated With Clinical and Pathological Response Following Neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX or Gemcitabine/Nab-Paclitaxel Chemotherapy in Resected Pancreatic Cancer.\nAuthors: Macedo FI, Ryon E, Maithel SK\nJournal: Annals of surgery\nPublication Date: 2019 Sep\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE: To compare the survival outcomes associated with clinical and pathological response in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) with FOLFIRINOX (FLX) or gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel (GNP) followed by curative-intent pancreatectomy. BACKGROUND: Newer multiagent NAC regimens have resulted in improved clinical and pathological responses in PDAC; however, the effects of these responses on survival outcomes remain unknown. METHODS: Clinicopathological and survival data of PDAC patients treated at 7 academic medical centers were analyzed. Primary outcomes were overall survival (OS), local recurrence-free survival (L-RFS), and metastasis-free survival (MFS) associated with biochemical (CA 19-9 decrease >/=50% vs <50%) and pathological response (complete, pCR; partial, pPR or limited, pLR) following NAC. RESULTS: Of 274 included patients, 46.4% were borderline resectable, 25.5% locally advanced, and 83.2% had pancreatic head/neck tumors. Vein resection was performed in 34.7% and 30-day mortality was 2.2%. R0 and pCR rates were 82.5% and 6%, respectively. Median, 3-year, and 5-year OS were 32 months, 46.3%, and 30.3%, respectively. OS, L-RFS, and MFS were superior in patients with marked biochemical response (CA 19-9 decrease >/=50% vs <50%; OS: 42.3 vs 24.3 months, P < 0.001; L-RFS-27.3 vs 14.1 months, P = 0.042; MFS-29.3 vs 13 months, P = 0.047) and pathological response [pCR vs pPR vs pLR: OS- not reached (NR) vs 40.3 vs 26.1 months, P < 0.001; L-RFS-NR vs 24.5 vs 21.4 months, P = 0.044; MFS-NR vs 23.7 vs 20.2 months, P = 0.017]. There was no difference in L-RFS, MFS, or OS between patients who received FLX or GNP. CONCLUSION: This large, multicenter study shows that improved biochemical, pathological, and clinical responses associated with NAC FLX or GNP result in improved OS, L-RFS, and MFS in PDAC. NAC with FLX or GNP has similar survival outcomes.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 26638785\nTitle: [mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy enabling curative resection in a patient with locally advanced duodenal adenocarcinoma and lymph node metastases].\nAuthors: Sasaki H, Kaneto H, Iida T\nJournal: Nihon Shokakibyo Gakkai zasshi = The Japanese journal of gastro-enterology\nPublication Date: 2015 Dec\nAbstract: A 65-year-old man was referred to our hospital with a primary complaint of unintentional weight loss. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed a large duodenal tumor, and computed tomography (CT) showed tumor invasion of the pancreatic head, associated with lymph node swelling around the tumor and abdominal aorta. After 4 courses of chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6), follow-up upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and biopsy showed no evidence of a duodenal tumor. However, follow-up CT showed persistent lymph node swelling near the superior mesenteric artery. The patient therefore underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy with curative intent. At 18 months after the surgery, there were no findings suggestive of tumor recurrence.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

BACKGROUND: Newer multiagent NAC regimens have resulted in improved clinical and pathological responses in PDAC; however, the effects of these responses on survival outcomes remain unknown. METHODS: Clinicopathological and survival data of PDAC patients treated at 7 academic medical centers were analyzed. Primary outcomes were overall survival (OS), local recurrence-free survival (L-RFS), and metastasis-free survival (MFS) associated with biochemical (CA 19-9 decrease >/=50% vs <50%) and pathological response (complete, pCR; partial, pPR or limited, pLR) following NAC. RESULTS: Of 274 included patients, 46.4% were borderline resectable, 25.5% locally advanced, and 83.2% had pancreatic head/neck tumors. Vein resection was performed in 34.7% and 30-day mortality was 2.2%. R0 and pCR rates were 82.5% and 6%, respectively. Median, 3-year, and 5-year OS were 32 months, 46.3%, and 30.3%, respectively. OS, L-RFS, and MFS were superior in patients with marked biochemical response (CA 19-9 decrease >/=50% vs <50%; OS: 42.3 vs 24.3 months, P < 0.001; L-RFS-27.3 vs 14.1 months, P = 0.042; MFS-29.3 vs 13 months, P = 0.047) and pathological response [pCR vs pPR vs pLR: OS- not reached (NR) vs 40.3 vs 26.1 months, P < 0.001; L-RFS-NR vs 24.5 vs 21.4 months, P = 0.044; MFS-NR vs 23.7 vs 20.2 months, P = 0.017]. There was no difference in L-RFS, MFS, or OS between patients who received FLX or GNP. CONCLUSION: This large, multicenter study shows that improved biochemical, pathological, and clinical responses associated with NAC FLX or GNP result in improved OS, L-RFS, and MFS in PDAC. NAC with FLX or GNP has similar survival outcomes.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 33022767\nTitle: Even a partial pathological response is associated with lower relapse rates in patients with operable rectal cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\nAuthors: Koizumi M, Yamada T, Shinji S\nJournal: Journal of surgical oncology\nPublication Date: 2021 Jan\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy to treat locally advanced rectal cancer is an effective therapeutic strategy for the prevention of local recurrence and distant organ metastasis after surgery. OBJECTIVES: To assess the prognostic significance of histopathological tumor response in rectal cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS: This study included patients with operable rectal cancer who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy using the FOLFOX regimen (5-fluorouracil, l-leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) in a hospital between February 2012 and November 2017. The main outcome measure was disease-free survival with respect to histopathological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in resected specimens. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 32 months. Of 48 patients treated with neoadjuvant FOLFOX, 24 (50%) were classified as responders, which included two patients with pathological complete response and 22 patients with partial response. The remaining 24 patients (50%) were classified as nonresponders. Responders had a significantly better 3-year disease-free survival than nonresponders (86% vs. 62%, p = .02). CONCLUSIONS: Patients whose surgical specimens show a pathological complete response or partial response have good oncologic outcomes.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

The PubMed search results suggest that the FOLFOX regimen can be effective in treating pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and that improved biochemical and pathological responses to the regimen are associated with improved overall survival, local recurrence-free survival, and metastasis-free survival.\n\nIn particular, Article #1 suggests that patients with marked biochemical response (CA 19-9 decrease >/=50% vs <50%) and pathological response (complete, pCR; partial, pPR or limited, pLR) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel have superior overall survival, local recurrence-free survival, and metastasis-free survival.\n\nArticle #2 suggests that even a partial pathological response is associated with lower relapse rates in patients with operable rectal cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy with the FOLFOX regimen.\n\nBased on this information, I would estimate that the patient's cancer has a moderate to high risk of recurrence in the next 12 months, but that the risk can be reduced with continued treatment and monitoring.\n\nTherefore, I would recommend the following:\n\n* Continue the FOLFOX regimen as prescribed by the patient's oncologist\n* Monitor the patient's CA 19-9 levels and other biomarkers regularly to assess the effectiveness of the treatment\n* Consider additional treatments or interventions if the cancer recurs or progresses\n\nANSWER: B)"

chemotherapy drug in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

chemotherapy drug in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: timeline1.txt] included in your context\nAGE: 61.813, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 61.813, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 61.813, diagnosis > progression --> PROGRESSION: N, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, \nAGE: 61.813, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 61.813, labtest > ca_19-9_labs --> RESULT: 39, LR_UNIT_MEASURE: Units/ml, \nAGE: 61.813, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 2.6000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 62.049, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 62.049, diagnosis > progression --> PROGRESSION: N, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, \nAGE: 62.049, labtest > ca_19-9_labs --> RESULT: 35, LR_UNIT_MEASURE: Units/ml, \nAGE: 62.049, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 2.6000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 62.282, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 62.282, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 62.282, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 62.282, diagnosis > progression --> PROGRESSION: Indeterminate, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, \nAGE: 62.282, labtest > ca_19-9_labs --> RESULT: 24, LR_UNIT_MEASURE: Units/ml, \nAGE: 62.282, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 2.1000 ng/ml          \n\n[DrugBank: Veal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"
