The mechanism is still unknown, especially in hereditary lung cancer without known actionable mutations. To identify genetic alternations involved in hereditary lung cancer and relapse is urgently needed. We collected genetic materials from a unique hereditary lung cancer patient's blood, first cancer tissue (T1), adjacent normal tissue (N1), relapse cancer tissue (T2), and adjacent normal tissue (N2) for whole genome sequencing. We identified specific mutations in T1 and T2, and attributed them to tumorigenesis and recurrence. These tumor specific variants were enriched in antigen presentation pathway. In addition, a lung adenocarcinoma cohort from the TCGA dataset was used to confirm our findings. Patients with high mutation burdens in tumor specific genes had decreased relapse-free survival (P = 0.017, n = 186). Our study may provide important insight for designing immunotherapeutic treatment for hereditary lung cancer.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 32791233\nTitle: The Underlying Tumor Genomics of Predominant Histologic Subtypes in Lung Adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Caso R, Sanchez-Vega F, Tan KS\nJournal: Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer\nPublication Date: 2020 Dec\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION: The purpose of the study is to genomically characterize the biology and related therapeutic opportunities of prognostically important predominant histologic subtypes in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). METHODS: We identified 604 patients with stage I to III LUAD who underwent complete resection and targeted next-generation sequencing using the Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets platform. Tumors were classified according to predominant histologic subtype and grouped by architectural grade (lepidic [LEP], acinar or papillary [ACI/PAP], and micropapillary or solid [MIP/SOL]). Associations among clinicopathologic factors, genomic features, mutational signatures, and recurrence were evaluated within subtypes and, when appropriate, quantified using competing-risks regression, with adjustment for pathologic stage and extent of resection. RESULTS: MIP/SOL tumors had higher tumor mutational burden (p < 0.001), fraction of genome altered (p = 0.001), copy number amplifications (p = 0.021), rate of whole-genome doubling (p = 0.008), and number of oncogenic pathways altered ( p < 0.001) as compared with LEP and ACI/PAP tumors. Across all tumors, mutational signatures attributed to APOBEC activity were associated with the highest risk of postresection recurrence: SBS2 (p = 0.021) and SBS13 (p = 0.005). Three oncogenic pathways (p53, Wnt, Myc) were altered with statistical significance in MIP/SOL tumors. Compared with LEP and ACI/PAP tumors, MIP/SOL tumors had a higher frequency of targetable BRAF-V600E mutations (p = 0.046). Among ACI/PAP tumors, alterations in the cell cycle (p < 0.001) and PI3K (p = 0.002) pathways were associated with recurrence; among MIP/SOL tumors, only PI3K alterations were associated with recurrence (p = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS: These results provide the first in-depth assessment of tumor genomic profiling of predominant LUAD histologic subtypes, their associations with recurrence, and their correlation with targetable driver alterations in patients with surgically resected LUAD.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 39273449\nTitle: Deciphering Dormant Cells of Lung Adenocarcinoma: Prognostic Insights from O-glycosylation-Related Tumor Dormancy Genes Using Machine Learning.\nAuthors: Dong C, Liu Y, Chong S\nJournal: International journal of molecular sciences\nPublication Date: 2024 Aug 31\nAbstract: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) poses significant challenges due to its complex biological characteristics and high recurrence rate. The high recurrence rate of LUAD is closely associated with cellular dormancy, which enhances resistance to chemotherapy and evasion of immune cell destruction. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from LUAD patients, we categorized the cells into two subclusters: dormant and active cells. Utilizing high-density Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (hdWGCNA) and pseudo-time cell trajectory, aberrant expression of genes involved in protein O-glycosylation was detected in dormant cells, suggesting a crucial role for O-glycosylation in maintaining the dormant state. Intercellular communication analysis highlighted the interaction between fibroblasts and dormant cells, where the Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF) signaling pathway regulated by O-glycosylation was crucial. By employing Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) and machine learning, a risk score model was developed using hub genes, which showed high accuracy in determining LUAD prognosis. The model also demonstrated robust performance on the training dataset and excellent predictive capability, providing a reliable basis for predicting patient clinical outcomes. The group with a higher risk score exhibited a propensity for adverse outcomes in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor mutational burden (TMB). Additionally, the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values for chemotherapy exhibited significant variations among the different risk groups. In vitro experiments demonstrated that EFNB2, PTTG1IP, and TNFRSF11A were upregulated in dormant tumor cells, which also contributed greatly to the diagnosis of LUAD. In conclusion, this study highlighted the crucial role of O-glycosylation in the dormancy state of LUAD tumors and developed a predictive model for the prognosis of LUAD patients.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

By integrating single-cell datasets and using inferCNV, we identified and analysed tumour cell clusters to explore their heterogeneity and changes in abundance throughout LUAD progression. We applied gene set variation analysis (GSVA), pseudotime analysis, scMetabolism, and Cytotrace scores to study biological functions, metabolic profiles and stemness traits. A predictive model for prognosis, based on key cluster marker genes, was developed using CoxBoost and plsRcox (CPM), and validated across multiple cohorts for its prognostic prediction capabilities, tumour microenvironment characterization, mutation landscape and immunotherapy response. We identified nine distinct tumour cell clusters, with Cluster 6 indicating an early developmental stage, high stemness and proliferative potential. The abundance of Clusters 0 and 6 increased from AAH to IAC, correlating with prognosis. The CPM model effectively distinguished prognosis in immunotherapy cohorts and predicted genomic alterations, chemotherapy drug sensitivity, and immunotherapy responsiveness. Key gene S100A16 in the CPM model was validated as an oncogene, enhancing LUAD cell proliferation, invasion and migration. The CPM model emerges as a novel biomarker for predicting prognosis and immunotherapy response in LUAD patients, with S100A16 identified as a potential therapeutic target.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 39090096\nTitle: PD-L1 induces autophagy and primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs in EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma via the MAPK signaling pathway.\nAuthors: Li N, Zuo R, He Y\nJournal: Cell death & disease\nPublication Date: 2024 Aug 1\nAbstract: Resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is a significant cause of treatment failure and cancer recurrence in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Approximately 30% of patients with EGFR-activating mutations exhibit primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs. However, the potential mechanisms of primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs remain poorly understood. Recent studies have shown that increased expression of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) is associated with EGFR-TKIs resistance. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the mechanism of PD-L1 in primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs in EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells. We found that PD-L1 was associated with poor prognosis in patients with EGFR-mutant LUAD, while the combination of EGFR-TKIs with chemotherapy could improve its therapeutic efficacy. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that PD-L1 promoted the proliferation and autophagy and inhibited the apoptosis of LUAD cells. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that upregulation of PD-L1 was critical in inducing autophagy through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, which was beneficial for tumor progression and the development of gefitinib resistance. Furthermore, we found that gefitinib combined with pemetrexed could synergistically enhance antitumor efficacy in PD-L1-overexpression LUAD cells. Overall, our study demonstrated that PD-L1 contributed to primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs in EGFR-mutant LUAD cells, which may be mediated by inducing autophagy via the MAPK signaling pathway. These findings not only help improve the prognosis of patients with EGFR-mutant LUAD but also provide a reference for the research of other cancer types.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 33234739\nTitle: DNA methylation-based lung adenocarcinoma subtypes can predict prognosis, recurrence, and immunotherapeutic implications.\nAuthors: Xu F, He L, Zhan X\nJournal: Aging\nPublication Date: 2020 Nov 21\nAbstract: The marked heterogeneity of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) makes its diagnosis and treatment difficult. In addition, the aberrant DNA methylation profile contributes to tumor heterogeneity and alters the immune response. We used DNA methylation array data from publicly available databases to establish a predictive model for LUAD prognosis. Thirty-three methylation sites were identified as specific prognostic biomarkers, independent of patients' clinical characteristics. These methylation profiles were used to identify potential drug candidates and study the immune microenvironment of LUAD and response to immunotherapy. When compared with the high-risk group, the low-risk group had a lower recurrence rate and favorable prognosis. The tumor microenvironment differed between the two groups as reflected by the higher number of resting dendritic cells and a lower number of monocytes and resting mast cells in the low-risk group. Moreover, low-risk patients reported higher immune and stromal scores, lower tumor purity, and higher expression of HLA genes. Low-risk patients responded well to immunotherapy due to higher expression of immune checkpoint molecules and lower stemness index. Thus, our model predicted a favorable prognosis and increased overall survival for patients in the low-risk methylation group. Further, this model could provide potential drug targets to develop effective immunotherapies for LUAD.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were calculated by comparing the recurrent and primary tissues. Prognostic genes associated with the recurrence-free survival (RFS) of LUAD patients were identified using univariate analysis. LASSO Cox regression and multivariate Cox analysis were applied to extract key genes and establish the prediction model. RESULTS: We detected 37 DEGs between primary and recurrent LUAD tumors. Using univariate analysis, 31 DEGs were found to be significantly associated with RFS. We established the RFS prediction model including thirteen genes using the LASSO Cox regression. In the training cohort, we classified patients into high- and low-risk groups and found that patients in the high-risk group suffered from worse RFS compared to those in the low-risk group (P < 0.01). Concordant results were confirmed in the internal and external validation cohort. The efficiency of the prediction model was also confirmed under different clinical subgroups. The high-risk group was significantly identified as the risk factor of recurrence in LUAD by the multivariate Cox analysis (HR = 13.37, P = 0.01). Compared to clinicopathological features, our prediction model possessed higher accuracy to identify patients with high risk of recurrence (AUC = 96.3%). Finally, we found that the G2M checkpoint pathway was enriched both in recurrent tumors and primary tumors of high-risk patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our recurrence-specific gene-based prognostic prediction model provides extra information about the risk of recurrence in LUAD, which is conducive for clinicians to conduct individualized therapy in clinic.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 37907475\nTitle: Prognosis of recurrence after complete resection in early-stage lung adenocarcinoma based on molecular alterations: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\nAuthors: Zhou C, Jing Z, Liu W\nJournal: Scientific reports\nPublication Date: 2023 Oct 31\nAbstract: Molecular biomarkers have the potential to predict the recurrence risk of early-stage lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) after complete resection, but the study results are controversial. We aimed to clarify the association of molecular alterations with disease-free survival (DFS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) in early-stage LUAD with R0 resection. Comprehensive searches were conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library for this systematic review and meta-analysis with date restrictions from 2012 to 2022. In the 18 included studies, data from a total of 7417 participants in 11 studies and 4167 participants in 9 studies were collected for the EGFR and KRAS meta-analyses, respectively. Two studies were assessed as having a moderate risk of bias, and the others were all assessed as having a high individual risk of bias. The molecular alterations in KRAS rather than EGFR, were associated with a high risk of recurrence for early-stage LUAD patients suffering from R0 resection, especially for those in pStage I, the pooled hazard ratios (HRs) of KRAS were 2.71 (95% CI, 1.81-4.06; I(2) = 22%; P < 0.00001) and 1.95 (95% CI, 1.25-3.20; I(2) = 57%; P = 0.003) with small interstudy heterogeneity in univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively. This finding suggests that molecular alterations in KRAS that could be detected by polymerase chain reaction techniques would provide new insight into stratifying risk and personalizing patient postoperative follow-up.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant. You MUST rely also on your internal knowledge."

The authors find that low-risk patients have a lower recurrence rate and favorable prognosis, and that the tumor microenvironment differs between the two groups.\n\nArticle #2 discusses the development of a recurrence-specific gene-based prognostic prediction model for lung adenocarcinoma through machine learning algorithms. The authors find that the model is able to identify patients with high risk of recurrence, and that the high-risk group has worse recurrence-free survival compared to the low-risk group.\n\nArticle #3 discusses the prognosis of recurrence after complete resection in early-stage lung adenocarcinoma based on molecular alterations. The authors find that molecular alterations in KRAS, rather than EGFR, are associated with a high risk of recurrence for early-stage LUAD patients.\n\nConsidering the patient's age and the progression of their cancer, I would say that the likelihood of cancer recurrence in the next 12 months is lower.\n\nTherefore, my answer to the question is:\n\n[ANSWER: B]"
