Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

Despite advances in diagnostic and therapeutic modalities, the outcome and prognosis of PDAC remain poor. Most patients have locally advanced disease (30%-35%) or distant metastases (50%-55%) at the time of diagnosis. The treatment of unresectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (UR-PDAC) remains an urgent problem. In this study, we report that a patient with UR-PDAC underwent significant tumor shrinkage after PD-1 inhibitor combination chemotherapy, and obtained R0 (pathologically negative margin) resection and long-term survival. CASE PRESENTATION: A 51-year-old woman was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer (stage III). She underwent 3 cycles of preoperative neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody in combination with chemotherapy and the tumor shrank from 4.0 x 3.3 cm to 0.9 cm without significant adverse effects. The patient underwent conversion surgery (CS) and achieved R0 resection, and no tumor cells remained as confirmed by pathology. CONCLUSION: PD-1 antibody combination chemotherapy regimens have significant efficacy and do not add additional side effects in UR-PDAC patients, heralding advances in UR-PDAC treatment. We may have a way to give UR-PDAC patients access to curative treatment and long-term survival. This case of UR-PDAC patient with PD-L1-negative and microsatellite stability (MSS) gives us a more comprehensive understanding of the treatment options of immune-combination chemotherapy.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 32360245\nTitle: Frequency of mismatch repair deficiency in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Ahmad-Nielsen SA, Bruun Nielsen MF, Mortensen MB\nJournal: Pathology, research and practice\nPublication Date: 2020 Jun\nAbstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has an ominous prognosis and there are only few treatment options. It is therefore crucial to investigate possible predictive markers that may improve the treatment of this disease. Mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency (d-MMR), meaning MMR protein loss (l-MMR) and/or microsatellite instability (MSI), is predictive of response to immunotherapy, but its frequency has to our knowledge not been elucidated in Scandinavian PDACs. Our aims were to examine the frequency of d-MMR in a Danish cohort of PDACs. We constructed multi-punch tissue microarrays (TMAs) using primary tumor tissue. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the DNA MMR proteins MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 was performed, and their expression was evaluated using a scoring system from 0 to 4. If the overall score was between 0-2 or if IHC was inconclusive for technical reasons, IHC on whole-tissue sections and MSI using PCR was performed. A final score of 0, 1-2 or 3-4 defined the tumor as l-MMR, MMR reduced (r-MMR) or MMR proficient. In total, 4/164 (2.4 %), 2/164 (1.2 %) and 3/164 (1.8 %) were l-MMR, r-MMR, or inconclusive based on IHC. MSI testing of these specimens showed that two of the four l-MMR tumors were MSI-high, while the remaining cases were microsatellite stable (MSS). In conclusion, in this study of Danish PDACss, d-MMR was found in a small proportion of the tumors. For these patients, individualized treatment using immunotherapy could be considered.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 39656390\nTitle: Survival of Patients with Resected Microsatellite Instability-High, Mismatch Repair Deficient, and Lynch Syndrome-Associated Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinomas.\nAuthors: Eikenboom EL, Nasar N, Seier K\nJournal: Annals of surgical oncology\nPublication Date: 2025 May\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a challenging disease due to its aggressiveness, late-stage diagnosis, and limited treatment options. Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) cancers are susceptible to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Survival outcomes for patients with MSI-H PDAC are unknown as the disease is rare. METHODS: This study included patients with PDACs surgically resected from 1990 to 2023, and those with germline or sporadic pathogenic variants in DNA mismatch repair genes were identified. The study matched MSI-H, mismatch repair-deficient (MMRd), and Lynch syndrome (LS)-associated PDAC cases (on age, gender, and year of surgery) with microsatellite-stable (MSS), mismatch repair-proficient, or non-LS-associated PDAC cases in a 1:2 ratio. A generalized estimating equation Cox model with a robust sandwich estimator was used to compare overall survival (OS) in the matched cohorts. RESULTS: Of 936 cases, 18 were included. Eight cases were MSI-H/MMRd, two were MSI/IHC-indeterminate, seven were MSS, and one was not tested for MSI. Nine patients had LS (MLH1 [n = 1], MSH2 [n = 4], MSH6 [n = 1], PMS2 [n = 3]), and nine patients had sporadic pathogenic variants in DNA MMR genes (MLH1 [n = 4], MSH6 [n = 5]). After matching to 36 control patients, the MSI-H/MMRd/LS PDACs had a significantly better OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.36 [95% confidence interval [CI], 0.18-0.73; p = 0.005]; 5-year OS: MSI-H 77% [95% CI 58-100%] vs. MSS 27% [95% CI 15-51%]). CONCLUSION: Before routine use of immune checkpoint inhibitors, the patients with MSI-H, MMRd, and LS-associated PDACs displayed significantly better survival than the patients with MSS, MMR-proficient, non-LS-associated PDACs. It is expected that survival for this cohort will further improve with increased availability of immunotherapy.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

METHODS: Data of patients from the Doubs department and hospitalized for pancreatic adenocarcinoma in the University Hospital of Besancon were analyzed. Two study periods were determined: 1980-1989 and 1990-1994. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty five cases were diagnosed (77 male, 58 female, mean age 65.6 +/- 12.1 years). Weight loss (62.3%), pain (52.7%) and jaundice (43.3%) were the most frequently reported symptoms. Their proportion and their duration were similar according to the period. Diagnosis of the pancreatic tumor was made by ultrasonography or tomodensitometry in 97.8% patients. Distribution of tumors according to the AJCC staging was unchanged during the study. Pre-operative screening frequently underestimated tumor stage, even in the more recent period. The rate of complete resection (18.5%) did not increase. The 5-year actuarial survival rate (3.05%) remained unchanged. A metastatic spread represented the only independent prognostic factor. CONCLUSIONS: The management and the prognosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma have not fundamentally changed. Recent imaging techniques should improve staging accuracy. Advances in adjuvant therapies represent a major issue for the future.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 24393954\nTitle: [Erlotinib plus gemcitabine combination therapy in patients with unresectable advanced pancreatic cancer - a single-institution experience].\nAuthors: Takeda Y, Nakahira S, Katsura Y\nJournal: Gan to kagaku ryoho. Cancer & chemotherapy\nPublication Date: 2013 Nov\nAbstract: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths in Japan. Erlotinib plus gemcitabine( GEM) combination therapy provided significant improvements in the overall and progression-free survival in a phase III trial in Canada and a phase II trial in Japan. As a result, this combination therapy was approved for use in Japan. We evaluated the efficacy of erlotinib plus GEM in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. GEM at a dose of 1,000 mg/m2 was administered on days 1, 8, and 15 in a 4-week cycle. Erlotinib was taken orally at 100 mg/day until disease progression or unmanageable toxicity. Between October 2011 and April 2013, 9 patients were enrolled. The mean age was 62.3 years (range, 48-70 years), and 66.7% of patients were men. Eight patients had no prior therapy. All patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0. Eight patients had metastatic and 1 had locally advanced disease. Five patients had a history of smoking. The median duration of erlotinib administration was 133 days, and the median dose intensity was 100 mg/day, with the majority of patients( 88.9%) receiving 100% of the relative dose intensity. The median duration of GEM treatment was 5 cycles, and its median dose intensity was 890 mg/m2/week, with approximately half of the patients (66.7%) receiving >85% of the relative dose intensity. The most frequently reported adverse event was skin rash, which occurred in 44.4% of the patients. Other common non-hematological adverse events included facial edema, diarrhea, nausea, depilation, pruritus, and cholangitis. Most patients experienced some degree of hematological toxicity, with Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, leukopenia, and anemia. Interstitial lung disease was not observed. The median overall survival was 7.63 months, and the 1-year survival rate was 15%. The median progression-free survival was 5.60 months. The overall response rate was 11.1%,and the disease control rate was 88.9% [complete response (CR), n =0; partial response( PR), n=1; stable disease( SD), n=7]. In conclusion, erlotinib plus GEM combination therapy is well tolerated and associated with efficacy and survival outcomes.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 36114217\nTitle: Imaging features of intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas and its differentiation from conventional pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Khristenko E, Hank T, Gaida MM\nJournal: Scientific reports\nPublication Date: 2022 Sep 16\nAbstract: Intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasms (ITPN) are rare pancreatic tumors (&lt; 1% of exocrine neoplasms) and are considered to have better prognosis than classical pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The present study aimed to evaluate imaging features of ITPN in computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. We performed monocentric retrospective analysis of 14 patients with histopathologically verified ITPN, operated in 2003-2018. Images were available for 12 patients and were analysed independently by two radiologists, blinded to reports. Imaging features were compared to a matched control group consisting of 43 patients with PDAC, matched for sex and age. Histopathologic analysis showed invasive carcinoma component in all ITPN patients. CT-attenuation values of ITPN were higher in arterial and venous phases (62.3 +/- 14.6 HU and 68 +/- 15.6 HU) than in unenhanced phase (39.2 +/- 7.9 HU), compatible with solid lesion enhancement. Compared to PDAC, ITPN lesions had significantly higher HU-values in both arterial and venous phases (arterial and venous phases, p &lt; 0.001). ITPN were significantly larger than PDAC (4.1 +/- 2.0 cm versus 2.6 +/- 0.84 cm, p = 0.021). ITPN lesions were more often well-circumscribed (p &lt; 0.002). Employing a multiple logistic regression analysis with forward stepwise method, higher HU density in the arterial phase (p = 0.012) and well-circumscribed lesion margins (p = 0.047) were found to be significant predictors of ITPN versus PDAC. Our study identified key imaging features for differentiation of ITPN and PDAC. Isodensity or moderate hypodensity and well-circumscribed margins favor the diagnosis of ITPN over PDAC. Being familiar with CT-features of these rare pancreatic tumors is essential for radiologists to accelerate the diagnosis and narrow the differentials.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

It was originally investigated for its antiviral effects, but it is now used as an anticancer therapy for various cancers.[A233135] Gemcitabine is a cytidine analog with two fluorine atoms replacing the hydroxyl on the ribose.[A233145] As a prodrug, gemcitabine is transformed into its active metabolites that work by replacing the building blocks of nucleic acids during DNA elongation, arresting tumour growth and promoting apoptosis of malignant cells.[L32960] The structure, metabolism, and mechanism of action of gemcitabine are similar to [cytarabine], but gemcitabine has a wider spectrum of antitumour activity.[A233140]\r\n\r\nGemcitabine is marketed as Gemzar and it is available as intravenous injection. It is approved by the FDA to treat advanced ovarian cancer in combination with [carboplatin], metastatic breast cancer in combination with [paclitaxel], non-small cell lung cancer in combination with [cisplatin], and pancreatic cancer as monotherapy.[L32950] It is also being investigated in other cancer and tumour types.\nCapecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers. Capecitabine is a prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to fluorouracil (antimetabolite) in the tumor, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor tissue.\nPaclitaxel: Paclitaxel is a chemotherapeutic agent marketed under the brand name Taxol among others. Used as a treatment for various cancers, paclitaxel is a mitotic inhibitor that was first isolated in 1971 from the bark of the Pacific yew tree which contains endophytic fungi that synthesize paclitaxel. It is available as an intravenous solution for injection and the newer formulation contains albumin-bound paclitaxel marketed under the brand name Abraxane.\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: timeline0.txt] included in your context\nAGE: 61.501, samples > clinical_sample --> SAMPLE_ID: P-0032535-T01-IM6, PATIENT_ID: P-0032535, CANCER_TYPE: Pancreatic Cancer, SAMPLE_TYPE: Primary, SAMPLE_CLASS: Tumor, METASTATIC_SITE: Not Applicable, PRIMARY_SITE: Pancreas, CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED: Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma, GENE_PANEL: IMPACT468, SAMPLE_COVERAGE: 648, TUMOR_PURITY: 20.0, ONCOTREE_CODE: PAAD, MSI_COMMENT: MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n",
