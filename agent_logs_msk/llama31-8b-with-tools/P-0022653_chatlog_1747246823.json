While there is clear benefit from adjuvant systemic treatment for patients with early-stage triple negative and HER2 positive breast cancer, it was unclear in the past which patient with luminal breast cancer needs adjuvant chemotherapy. As a result, we used to overtreat or undertreat patients. In the era of personalized treatment, genomic panels have become as or more important than the anatomic extent of disease to define prognosis in luminal breast cancer. Several gene expression assays are available for consideration of adjuvant systemic therapy categorizing patients according to genomic risk for recurrence (e.g., Oncotype, Mammaprint, etc). Except for the high and low risk signature, more recently Mammaprint announced that patients with ultra-low risk signature have excellent prognosis, distinctive from low risk with 8-year BCSS above 99%, regardless of age, clinical risk or treatment received. Very few patients developed distant metastasis, allowing physicians to de-escalate treatment plans.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 20521754\nTitle: Treatment of breast cancer.\nAuthors: Maughan KL, Lutterbie MA, Ham PS\nJournal: American family physician\nPublication Date: 2010 Jun 1\nAbstract: Understanding breast cancer treatment options can help family physicians care for their patients during and after cancer treatment. This article reviews typical treatments based on stage, histology, and biomarkers. Lobular carcinoma in situ does not require treatment. Ductal carcinoma in situ can progress to invasive cancer and is treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiation therapy without further lymph node exploration or systemic therapy. Stages I and II breast cancers are usually treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiation therapy. Radiation therapy following breast-conserving surgery decreases mortality and recurrence. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is considered for most breast cancers with clinically negative axillary lymph nodes, and it does not have the adverse effects of arm swelling and pain that are associated with axillary lymph node dissection. Choice of adjuvant systemic therapy depends on lymph node involvement, hormone receptor status, ERBB2 (formerly HER2 or HER2/neu) overexpression, and patient age and menopausal status. In general, node-positive breast cancer is treated systemically with chemotherapy, endocrine therapy (for hormone receptor-positive cancer), and trastuzumab (for cancer overexpressing ERBB2). Anthracycline- and taxane-containing chemotherapeutic regimens are active against breast cancer. Stage III breast cancer typically requires induction chemotherapy to downsize the tumor to facilitate breast-conserving surgery. Inflammatory breast cancer, although considered stage III, is aggressive and requires induction chemotherapy followed by mastectomy, rather than breastconserving surgery, as well as axillary lymph node dissection and chest wall radiation. Prognosis is poor in women with recurrent or metastatic (stage IV) breast cancer, and treatment options must balance benefits in length of life and reduced pain against harms from treatment.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 17849084\nTitle: Treatment and prognosis of brain metastases from breast cancer.\nAuthors: Ogawa K, Yoshii Y, Nishimaki T\nJournal: Journal of neuro-oncology\nPublication Date: 2008 Jan\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: To analyze retrospectively the results of treatments for patients with brain metastases from breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The records of 65 breast cancer patients with brain metastases who were treated between 1985 and 2005 were reviewed. For brain metastases, 11 patients (17%) were treated with surgical resection followed by radiotherapy, and the remaining 54 patients were treated with radiotherapy alone. Systemic chemotherapy was also administered to 11 patients after brain radiotherapy. RESULTS: The overall median survival for all patients was 6.1 months (range, 0.4-82.2 months). In univariate analysis, treatment modality, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), administration of systemic chemotherapy, extracranial disease status and total radiation dose each had significant impact on overall survival, and in multivariate analysis, treatment modality, KPS and administration of systemic chemotherapy were significant prognostic factors. Eight patients survived for more than 2 years after the diagnosis of brain metastases, and all these patients were treated with surgical resection and/or systemic chemotherapy in addition to radiotherapy. For the 45 patients treated with palliative radiotherapy (without systemic chemotherapy), the improvements in neurological symptoms were observed in 35 patients (78%), with the median duration of improvement of 3.1 months (range, 1.5-4.4 months). CONCLUSIONS: The prognoses for patients with brain metastases from breast cancer were generally poor, although selected patients may survive longer with intensive brain tumor treatment, such as surgical resection and/or systemic chemotherapy in addition to brain radiotherapy. For patients with unfavorable prognoses, palliative radiotherapy was effective in improving the quality of the remaining lifetime.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

immunosuppressive agent that must be activated in the liver to form the active aldophosphamide. It has been used in the treatment of lymphoma and leukemia. Its side effect, alopecia, has been used for defleecing sheep. Cyclophosphamide may also cause sterility, birth defects, mutations, and cancer.\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nMethotrexate: Methotrexate is a folate derivative that inhibits several enzymes responsible for nucleotide synthesis.[A180322] This inhibition leads to suppression of inflammation as well as prevention of cell division.[A180322] Because of these effects, methotrexate is often used to treat inflammation caused by arthritis or to control cell division in neoplastic diseases such as breast cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.[A180322,L7144,L7147,L7150,L7180]\r\n\r\nDue to the toxic effects of methotrexate, it is indicated for treatment of some forms of arthritis and severe psoriasis only if first line treatment has failed or patients are intolerant of those treatments.[L7180]\r\n\r\nMethotrexate was granted FDA approval on 7 December 1953.[L7198]\nTamoxifen: Tamoxifen is a non-steroidal antiestrogen used to treat estrogen receptor positive breast cancers as well as prevent the incidence of breast cancer in high risk populations.[A1025,L7799,L7802] Tamoxifen is used alone or as an adjuvant in these treatments.[L7799,L7802] Tamoxifen may no longer be the preferred treatment for these types of cancers as patients generally have better survival, side effect profiles, and compliance with [anastrozole].[A1026]\r\n\r\nTamoxifen was granted FDA approval on 30 December 1977.[L7799]\nDoxorubicin: Doxorubicin is a cytotoxic anthracycline antibiotic isolated from cultures of Streptomyces peucetius var. caesius along side with daunorubicin, another cytotoxic agent, in 1970.[A1575,A257709,A257614] Although they both have aglyconic and sugar moieties, doxorubicin's side chain terminates with a primary alcohol group compared to the methyl group of daunorubicin.[A257709] Although its detailed molecular mechanisms have yet to be understood, doxorubicin is generally thought to exert its effect through DNA intercalation, which eventually leads to DNA damage and the generation of reactive oxygen species.[A257614] Thanks to its efficacy and broad effect, doxorubicin was approved by the FDA in 1974 to treat a variety of cancer, including but not limited to breast, lung, gastric, ovarian, thyroid, non-Hodgkin\u2019s and Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, multiple myeloma, sarcoma, and pediatric cancers.[A1573,A257614,L45231] However, one of the major side effects of doxorubicin is cardiotoxicity, which excludes patients with poor heart function and requires treatment termination once the maximally tolerated cumulative dose is reached.[A257719]\nPaclitaxel: Paclitaxel is a chemotherapeutic agent marketed under the brand name Taxol among others. Used as a treatment for various cancers, paclitaxel is a mitotic inhibitor that was first isolated in 1971 from the bark of the Pacific yew tree which contains endophytic fungi that synthesize paclitaxel. It is available as an intravenous solution for injection and the newer formulation contains albumin-bound paclitaxel marketed under the brand name Abraxane.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"
