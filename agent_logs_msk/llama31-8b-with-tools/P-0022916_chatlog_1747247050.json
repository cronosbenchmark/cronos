Oxaliplatin: Oxaliplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

Oxaliplatin: Oxaliplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

Cancer & chemotherapy\nPublication Date: 2014 Nov\nAbstract: A female patient in her 70s underwent an abdominoperineal resection and bilateral lymph node dissection for advanced lower rectal cancer. The patient did not receive neoadjuvant therapy. In the Japanese classification of colorectal carcinoma (8th Edition), the tumor was a moderately differentiated type 2 adenocarcinoma, and was 4.5 cm in size. Histologically, the tumor was considered to be Stage IIIb (T3N0M0). She received no adjuvant chemotherapy. After 39 months, pelvic computed tomography (CT ) revealed a 29 mm tumor in the right pelvic wall. The patient declined surgery for recurrence so radiotherapy was planned. First, chemotherapy with mFOLFOX6 was administered for 4 courses to reduce tumor size. Consequently, irradiation with carbon ions was given to the site of recurrence at a total dose of 74 GyE in 37 fractions. There were no severe complications. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level decreased to the lower limit of the normal range from a maximum of 4.9, and no progression of the recurrent tumor was detected on CT for approximately 4 years. Systemic chemotherapy followed by irradiation with carbon ions may be effective for recurrent rectal cancer.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 19728908\nTitle: [Risk factors related to lymph node metastases after neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced rectal cancer].\nAuthors: Zeng ZF, Ding PR, Pan ZZ\nJournal: Ai zheng = Aizheng = Chinese journal of cancer\nPublication Date: 2009 Sep\nAbstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Neoadjuvant therapy (radiotherapy, RT or chemoradiotherapy, CRT) could change status of the invasion and lymph node metastasis of rectal cancer. The risk factors of lymph node metastasis in rectal cancers without neoadjuvant therapy have been well known, but those in rectal cancers treated with preoperative RT or CRT remain unclear. This study was to investigate the risk factors of lymph node metastasis in patients who underwent preoperative RT or CRT for rectal cancers. METHODS: Clinical data of 93 patients underwent preoperative RT or CRT followed by total mesorectal exesion (TME) for locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma from August, 2003 to February, 2008 were reviewed. Twelve clinicopathologic factors and treatment-related factors were studied with univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed that post-RT or post-CRT serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, radiation dose, time interval from RT or CRT to TME, concurrent chemotherapy with oxaliplatin-containing regimens, and infiltration extent to bowel wall after RT or CRT (ypT stage) were significantly associated with lymph node status after RT or CRT (ypN stage). Multivariate analysis showed that concurrent chemotherapy with oxaliplatin-containing regimens (r=-0.481, P<0.01) and ypT stage (r=0.503, P<0.01) were independent risk factors of ypN stage. CONCLUSIONS: Pathologic T stage is the most reliable predictor of lymph node stage in rectal cancer patients received preoperative RT or CRT. Oxaliplatin-containing regimens could significantly reduce the risks of lymph node metastases and potentially improve the prognosis.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 33171467\nTitle: Prognostic Value of Pretreatment Serum CA199 in Patients with Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer Treated with CRT Followed by TME with Normal Pretreatment Carcinoembryonic Antigen Levels.\nAuthors: Huang D, Lin Q, Song J\nJournal: Digestive surgery\nPublication Date: 2021\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Elevated pretreatment carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels are related to poor prognosis in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) treated with neo-CRT followed by TME. In patients with normal pretreatment CEA levels, the prognostic significance of carbohydrate antigen 199 (CA199) is controversial. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore the prognostic value of pretreatment serum CA199 in patients with LARC who had normal pretreatment CEA levels treated with neo-CRT followed by curative surgery. METHODS: A retrospective study of 456 patients with LARC treated with neo-CRT followed by TME between January 2006 and May 2017 was performed. We employed the maximal chi2 method to determine the CA199 threshold of 9.1 U/mL based on the difference in survival and divided patients into 2 groups. Group 1: patients with pretreatment s-CEA < 5 ng/mL and CA199 >/= 9.1 U/mL. Group 2: patients with pretreatment s-CEA < 5 ng/mL and CA199 < 9.1 U/mL. Overall survival (OS) across CA199 was assessed using Cox proportional hazard regression models (PS:CEA >/= 5 ng/mL was seen as elevated). RESULTS: Multivariate analyses demonstrated that the following factors were significantly related to OS in patients with LARC with normal pretreatment CEA levels: ypT (odds ratio [OR] 1.863, p = 0.030), ypN (OR 1.622, p = 0.026), and pretreatment CA199 levels (OR 1.886, p = 0.048). CONCLUSION: Pretreatment CA199 is an independent factor for OS in patients with LARC with normal pretreatment CEA levels, which may reach the clinic to guide individualized decision-making.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Oxaliplatin: Oxaliplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

administered by rapid injection. Floxuridine is available as a sterile, nonpyrogenic, lyophilized powder for reconstitution. When administered by slow, continuous, intra-arterial infusion, it is converted to floxuridine monophosphate. It has been used to treat hepatic metastases of gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and for palliation in malignant neoplasms of the liver and gastrointestinal tract.\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nUridine: nan\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: timeline0.txt] included in your context\nAGE: 54.850, samples > clinical_sample --> SAMPLE_ID: P-0022916-T01-IM6, PATIENT_ID: P-0022916, CANCER_TYPE: Colorectal Cancer, SAMPLE_TYPE: Primary, SAMPLE_CLASS: Tumor, METASTATIC_SITE: Not Applicable, PRIMARY_SITE: Rectum, CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED: Rectal Adenocarcinoma, GENE_PANEL: IMPACT468, SAMPLE_COVERAGE: 777, TUMOR_PURITY: 30.0, ONCOTREE_CODE: READ, MSI_COMMENT: MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

Oxaliplatin: Oxaliplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite.

In a randomized controlled trial of 849 patients, the value of preoperative radiotherapy in those with operable rectal adenocarcinoma was examined. After a minimum follow-up of 4 years, 156 patients who developed local recurrence were studied retrospectively. There were no differences concerning symptoms and the site of local recurrence between irradiated and non-irradiated patients. Curative treatment was rarely possible and median survival was only about 1 year, irrespective of adjuvant treatment. Local recurrence was the only manifestation of disease in 30-50 per cent of patients. An earlier and more aggressive surgical approach might improve survival.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 25944426\nTitle: Lymphovascular invasion: a comprehensive appraisal in colon and rectal adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Hogan J, Chang KH, Duff G\nJournal: Diseases of the colon and rectum\nPublication Date: 2015 Jun\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Colon and rectal adenocarcinomas differ at a multitude of levels. The association between outcome and predictor in 1 group may obscure the relationship between outcome and predictor in the other. OBJECTIVE: The current study aims to evaluate the prognostic properties of lymphovascular invasion in colon and rectal adenocarcinoma separately. MATERIALS AND METHODS (DESIGN, SETTING AND PATIENTS): A comparative retrospective analysis was undertaken to determine the prognostic properties of lymphovascular invasion in colon and rectal adenocarcinomas. Patients were classified as lymphovascular invasion positive and lymphovascular invasion negative in separate colon and rectal cancer cohorts. Within cohorts, a univariate analysis was undertaken to determine the association between lymphovascular invasion positivity and local/systemic recurrence and overall/disease-free survival. Findings were evaluated by using Kaplan-Meier estimates, log-rank analysis, and a Cox proportional hazards multivariate model. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcomes measured were overall and disease-free survival. RESULTS: Five hundred twenty-seven patients were included in the analysis (379 with colon cancer and 148 with rectal cancer). On univariate analysis, lymphovascular invasion positivity was associated with adverse locoregional recurrence in colon (p = 0.002) but not rectal adenocarcinoma (p = 0.13). Conversely, lymphovascular invasion positivity was associated with adverse systemic recurrence in rectal (p = 0.002) but not colon adenocarcinoma (p = 0.35). On multivariate analysis, lymphovascular invasion positivity was an independent predictor of adverse disease-free survival in colon (p = 0.02) and rectal adenocarcinoma (p < 0.001). Regarding overall survival, lymphovascular invasion positivity was a poor prognostic indicator in rectal adenocarcinoma only (p = 0.04). LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective analysis, lymphovascular invasion positivity was associated with different patterns of disease recurrence in colon and rectal cancer. Lymphovascular invasion positivity was associated with adverse overall survival in rectal cancer only.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 12163970\nTitle: Local recurrence and survival after laparoscopic mesorectal resection forrectal adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Poulin EC, Schlachta CM, Gregoire R\nJournal: Surgical endoscopy\nPublication Date: 2002 Jun\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic resection for rectal cancer is controversial. Actuarial survival and local recurrence rates have not been determined. METHODS: A prospective database containing 80 consecutive unselected laparoscopic resections of rectal cancers performed between November 1991 and 1999 was reviewed. Local recurrence was defined as any detectable local disease at follow-up assessment occurring either alone or in conjunction with generalized recurrence. The tumor node metastases (TNM) classification for colorectal cancers and the Kaplan-Meier method were used to determine staging and survival curves. The mesorectal excision technique was used during surgery. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 31 months for patients with stages I, II, and III cancer, and 15.5 months for patients with stage IV cancer. The overall 5-year survival rate was 65.1% for all cancer stages and 72.1% for stages I, II, and III cancer. No trocar-site recurrence was observed. The overall local recurrence rate was 3.75% (3/80) for all cancer stages, and 4.3% (3/70) for stages I, II, and III cancer. CONCLUSIONS: The survival and local recurrence rates for patients with rectal cancer treated by laparoscopic mesorectal excision do not differ negatively from those in the literature for open mesorectal excision. Further validation is needed.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Our aim was to comprehensively map complex interactions between the mRNA expression patterns and the clinical traits of RC. We employed the integrated analysis of five microarray datasets and The Cancer Genome Atlas rectal adenocarcinoma database to identify 2118 consensual differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in RC and adjacent normal tissue samples, and then applied weighted gene co-expression network analysis to parse DEGs and eight clinical traits in 66 eligible RC samples. A total of 16 co-expressed gene modules were identified. The green-yellow and salmon modules were most appropriate to the pathological stage (R = 0.36) and the overall survival (HR =13.534, P = 0.014), respectively. A diagnostic model of the five pathological stage hub genes (SCG3, SYP, CDK5R2, AP3B2, and RUNDC3A) provided a powerful classification accuracy between localized RC and non-localized RC. We also found increased Secretogranin III (SCG3) expression with higher pathological stage and poorer prognosis in the test and validation set. The increased Homer scaffolding protein 2 (HOMER2) expression with the favorable survival prediction efficiency significantly correlated with the markedly reduced overall survival of RC patients and the higher pathological stage during the test and validation set. Our findings indicate that the SCG3 and HOMER2 mRNA levels should be further evaluated as predictors of pathological stage and survival in patients with RC.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 34269159\nTitle: Expression levels of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligands CXCL1 and CXCL3 as prognostic biomarkers in rectal adenocarcinoma: evidence from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) analyses.\nAuthors: Lv QY, Zou HZ, Xu YY\nJournal: Bioengineered\nPublication Date: 2021 Dec\nAbstract: Rectal cancer is a life\u2011threatening disease worldwide. Chemotherapy resistance is common in rectal adenocarcinoma patients and has unfavorable survival outcomes; however, its related molecular mechanisms remain unknown. To identify genes related to the initiation and progression of rectal adenocarcinoma, three datasets were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. In total, differentially expressed genes were analyzed from 294 tumor and 277 para-carcinoma samples from patients with rectal cancer. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes functions were investigated. Cytoscape software and MicroRNA Enrichment Turned Network were applied to construct a protein-protein interaction network of the dependent hub genes and related microRNAs. The Oncomine database was used to identify hub genes. Additionally, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis was applied to determine the RNA expression level. Tumor immune infiltration was assessed using the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource database. The expression profiles of hub genes between stages, and their prognostic value, were also evaluated. During this study, data from The Cancer Genome Atlas were utilized. In rectal adenocarcinoma, four hub genes including CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, and GNG4 were highly expressed at the gene and RNA levels. The expression of CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL3 was regulated by has-miR-1-3p and had a strong positive correlation with macrophage and neutrophil. CXCL2 and CXCL3 were differentially expressed at different tumor stages. High expression levels of CXCL1 and CXCL3 predicted poor survival. In conclusion, the CXCL1 and CXCL3 genes may have potential for prognosis and molecular targeted therapy of rectal adenocarcinoma.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 33202796\nTitle: Mucinous and Non-Mucinous Rectal Adenocarcinoma-Differences in Treatment Response to Preoperative Radiotherapy.\nAuthors: Vernmark K, Sun XF, Holmqvist A\nJournal: Journal of personalized medicine\nPublication Date: 2020 Nov 13\nAbstract: There is a need to personalize the treatment for rectal cancer patients. The aim of this study was to analyze therapy response and prognosis after preoperative radiotherapy in rectal cancer patients with mucinous adenocarcinoma compared to those with non-mucinous adenocarcinoma. The study included retrospectively collected data from 433 patients, diagnosed with rectal cancer in the South East health care region in Sweden between 2004 and 2012. Patients with non-mucinous adenocarcinoma that received short-course radiotherapy before surgery had better overall survival, cancer specific survival, and disease-free survival, as well as distant- and local-recurrence-free survival (p = 0.003, p = 0.001, p = 0.002, p = 0.002, and p = 0.033, respectively) compared to the patients that received long-course radiotherapy with concomitant capecitabine. The results were still significant after adjusting for sex, age, stage, differentiation, and chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant setting, except for local-recurrence-free survival that was trending towards significance (p = 0.070). In patients with mucinous adenocarcinoma, no difference in survival was seen when comparing patients that had short-course radiotherapy and patients that had long-course radiotherapy. However, none of 18 patients with mucinous adenocarcinoma treated with long-course radiotherapy had local tumor progression, compared to 7% of 67 patients with non-mucinous adenocarcinoma. The results indicate that mucinous adenocarcinoma and non-mucinous adenocarcinoma may respond differently to radiotherapy.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant. You MUST rely also on your internal knowledge."

Floxuridine is available as a sterile, nonpyrogenic, lyophilized powder for reconstitution. When administered by slow, continuous, intra-arterial infusion, it is converted to floxuridine monophosphate. It has been used to treat hepatic metastases of gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and for palliation in malignant neoplasms of the liver and gastrointestinal tract.\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nUridine: nan\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

administered by rapid injection. Floxuridine is available as a sterile, nonpyrogenic, lyophilized powder for reconstitution. When administered by slow, continuous, intra-arterial infusion, it is converted to floxuridine monophosphate. It has been used to treat hepatic metastases of gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and for palliation in malignant neoplasms of the liver and gastrointestinal tract.\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nUridine: nan\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: timeline2.txt] included in your context\nAGE: 57.823, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 1.9000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 57.932, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 57.932, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 57.938, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 2.4000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 58.053, diagnosis > performance_status --> ECOG: 1, \nAGE: 58.110, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 2.2000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 58.162, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 58.162, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 58.165, diagnosis > performance_status --> ECOG: 0, \nAGE: 58.225, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 1.9000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 58.324, diagnosis > performance_status --> ECOG: 1, \nAGE: 58.340, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 1.5000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 58.417, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 58.417, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 58.423, diagnosis > performance_status --> ECOG: 0, \nAGE: 58.513, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 1.5000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 58.628, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 1.6000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 58.672, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 58.672, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 58.686, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 1.6000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 58.743, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 1.6000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 58.858, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 1.6000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 58.902, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 58.902, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\n\n[DrugBank: Veal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: timeline0.txt] included in your context\nAGE: 54.850, samples > clinical_sample --> SAMPLE_ID: P-0022916-T01-IM6, PATIENT_ID: P-0022916, CANCER_TYPE: Colorectal Cancer, SAMPLE_TYPE: Primary, SAMPLE_CLASS: Tumor, METASTATIC_SITE: Not Applicable, PRIMARY_SITE: Rectum, CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED: Rectal Adenocarcinoma, GENE_PANEL: IMPACT468, SAMPLE_COVERAGE: 777, TUMOR_PURITY: 30.0, ONCOTREE_CODE: READ, MSI_COMMENT: MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

Oxaliplatin: Oxaliplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite.

Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

Based on cancer register data, differences in rectal cancer survival have been reported between countries in Europe. Variation in the distribution of stage at diagnosis, initial therapy including surgical technique, and comorbidity are possible explanatory factors. Adenocarcinomas in the rectum, diagnosed in 1997 and identified in the national cancer registries in the Nordic countries and Scotland were included. Age standardized 5-year relative survival and multiplicative regression models for the relative excess mortality were calculated. 3888 patients were included in the survival study. Men in Denmark, Finland and Iceland had lower 5-year relative survival and poorer stage distribution compared to Norway, Sweden and Scotland. Danish men had the highest rate of excess deaths in the first six months after diagnosis. Stage adjusted, the elevated relative excess mortality decreased and after six months the excess mortality rates were the same in all countries. The poor 5-year relative survival in Danish men was mainly due to a high excess rate of death during the first six months after diagnosis. The low survival in Finland and Iceland was not in accordance with other periods. For both countries this may be explained by random variation due to small numbers. The study emphasizes the need for high quality and detailed data in order to understand international survival differences, and cautions comparisons between large national samples and those of smaller areas.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Our aim was to comprehensively map complex interactions between the mRNA expression patterns and the clinical traits of RC. We employed the integrated analysis of five microarray datasets and The Cancer Genome Atlas rectal adenocarcinoma database to identify 2118 consensual differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in RC and adjacent normal tissue samples, and then applied weighted gene co-expression network analysis to parse DEGs and eight clinical traits in 66 eligible RC samples. A total of 16 co-expressed gene modules were identified. The green-yellow and salmon modules were most appropriate to the pathological stage (R = 0.36) and the overall survival (HR =13.534, P = 0.014), respectively. A diagnostic model of the five pathological stage hub genes (SCG3, SYP, CDK5R2, AP3B2, and RUNDC3A) provided a powerful classification accuracy between localized RC and non-localized RC. We also found increased Secretogranin III (SCG3) expression with higher pathological stage and poorer prognosis in the test and validation set. The increased Homer scaffolding protein 2 (HOMER2) expression with the favorable survival prediction efficiency significantly correlated with the markedly reduced overall survival of RC patients and the higher pathological stage during the test and validation set. Our findings indicate that the SCG3 and HOMER2 mRNA levels should be further evaluated as predictors of pathological stage and survival in patients with RC.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 34269159\nTitle: Expression levels of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligands CXCL1 and CXCL3 as prognostic biomarkers in rectal adenocarcinoma: evidence from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) analyses.\nAuthors: Lv QY, Zou HZ, Xu YY\nJournal: Bioengineered\nPublication Date: 2021 Dec\nAbstract: Rectal cancer is a life\u2011threatening disease worldwide. Chemotherapy resistance is common in rectal adenocarcinoma patients and has unfavorable survival outcomes; however, its related molecular mechanisms remain unknown. To identify genes related to the initiation and progression of rectal adenocarcinoma, three datasets were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. In total, differentially expressed genes were analyzed from 294 tumor and 277 para-carcinoma samples from patients with rectal cancer. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes functions were investigated. Cytoscape software and MicroRNA Enrichment Turned Network were applied to construct a protein-protein interaction network of the dependent hub genes and related microRNAs. The Oncomine database was used to identify hub genes. Additionally, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis was applied to determine the RNA expression level. Tumor immune infiltration was assessed using the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource database. The expression profiles of hub genes between stages, and their prognostic value, were also evaluated. During this study, data from The Cancer Genome Atlas were utilized. In rectal adenocarcinoma, four hub genes including CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, and GNG4 were highly expressed at the gene and RNA levels. The expression of CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL3 was regulated by has-miR-1-3p and had a strong positive correlation with macrophage and neutrophil. CXCL2 and CXCL3 were differentially expressed at different tumor stages. High expression levels of CXCL1 and CXCL3 predicted poor survival. In conclusion, the CXCL1 and CXCL3 genes may have potential for prognosis and molecular targeted therapy of rectal adenocarcinoma.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 33202796\nTitle: Mucinous and Non-Mucinous Rectal Adenocarcinoma-Differences in Treatment Response to Preoperative Radiotherapy.\nAuthors: Vernmark K, Sun XF, Holmqvist A\nJournal: Journal of personalized medicine\nPublication Date: 2020 Nov 13\nAbstract: There is a need to personalize the treatment for rectal cancer patients. The aim of this study was to analyze therapy response and prognosis after preoperative radiotherapy in rectal cancer patients with mucinous adenocarcinoma compared to those with non-mucinous adenocarcinoma. The study included retrospectively collected data from 433 patients, diagnosed with rectal cancer in the South East health care region in Sweden between 2004 and 2012. Patients with non-mucinous adenocarcinoma that received short-course radiotherapy before surgery had better overall survival, cancer specific survival, and disease-free survival, as well as distant- and local-recurrence-free survival (p = 0.003, p = 0.001, p = 0.002, p = 0.002, and p = 0.033, respectively) compared to the patients that received long-course radiotherapy with concomitant capecitabine. The results were still significant after adjusting for sex, age, stage, differentiation, and chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant setting, except for local-recurrence-free survival that was trending towards significance (p = 0.070). In patients with mucinous adenocarcinoma, no difference in survival was seen when comparing patients that had short-course radiotherapy and patients that had long-course radiotherapy. However, none of 18 patients with mucinous adenocarcinoma treated with long-course radiotherapy had local tumor progression, compared to 7% of 67 patients with non-mucinous adenocarcinoma. The results indicate that mucinous adenocarcinoma and non-mucinous adenocarcinoma may respond differently to radiotherapy.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Floxuridine is available as a sterile, nonpyrogenic, lyophilized powder for reconstitution. When administered by slow, continuous, intra-arterial infusion, it is converted to floxuridine monophosphate. It has been used to treat hepatic metastases of gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and for palliation in malignant neoplasms of the liver and gastrointestinal tract.\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nUridine: nan\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: timeline2.txt] included in your context\nAGE: 57.823, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 1.9000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 57.932, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 57.932, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 57.938, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 2.4000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 58.053, diagnosis > performance_status --> ECOG: 1, \nAGE: 58.110, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 2.2000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 58.162, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 58.162, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 58.165, diagnosis > performance_status --> ECOG: 0, \nAGE: 58.225, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 1.9000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 58.324, diagnosis > performance_status --> ECOG: 1, \nAGE: 58.340, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 1.5000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 58.417, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 58.417, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 58.423, diagnosis > performance_status --> ECOG: 0, \nAGE: 58.513, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 1.5000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 58.628, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 1.6000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 58.672, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 58.672, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 58.686, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 1.6000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 58.743, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 1.6000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 58.858, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 1.6000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 58.902, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 58.902, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\n\n[DrugBank: Veal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0022916-T01-IM6\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0022916\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Colorectal Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Rectum\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Rectal Adenocarcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT468\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 777, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 30.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"READ\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

Oxaliplatin: Oxaliplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n",
