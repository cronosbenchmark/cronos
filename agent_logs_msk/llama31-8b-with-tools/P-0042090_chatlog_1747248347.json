It was the first member of its class, which now also includes carboplatin and oxaliplatin.\nPemetrexed: Pemetrexed is a chemotherapy drug that is manufactured and marketed by Eli Lilly and Company under the brand name Alimta. It is indicated for use in combination with cisplatin for the treatment of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma whose disease is either unresectable or who are otherwise not candidates for curative surgery. Its use in non-small cell lung cancer has also been investigated.
