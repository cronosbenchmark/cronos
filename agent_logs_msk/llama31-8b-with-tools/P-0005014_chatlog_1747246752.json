9-residue peptide analogue of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Unlike the endogenous decapeptide GnRH, leuprolide contains a single D-amino acid (D-leucyl) residue, which helps to increase its circulating half-life from three to four minutes to approximately three hours.[A203222] As a GnRH mimic, leuprolide is capable of binding to the GnRH receptor (GnRHR) and inducing downstream modulation of both gonadotropin hormone and sex steroid levels. Prolonged activation of GnRHR results in significant downregulation of sex steroid levels, which is primarily responsible for the clinical efficacy of leuprolide in diverse conditions, including advanced prostate cancer, endometriosis, and central precocious puberty.[A203126, A203132]\r\n\r\nLeuprolide was first approved in 1985 as a daily subcutaneous injection under the tradename Lupron\u2122 by Abbvie Endocrine Inc.[L13850] Since this initial approval, various long-acting intramuscular and subcutaneous products have been developed such that patients can be dosed once every six months.[L13781, L13790] Leuprolide remains frontline therapy in all conditions for which it is indicated for use.\nBicalutamide: Bicalutamide is an oral non-steroidal anti-androgen for prostate cancer.

To assess the optimal value of castration levels and PSA reduction under hormone treatment. METHODS: We performed a bibliographic review through automatized search in the Pubmed bibliographic database and Clinical Key. The search strategy included the following terms: \"prostate cancer\" AND \"hormones\", \"metastatic prostate cancer\", \"testosterone\" AND \"prostate cancer\", \"hormone naive/sensitive\" AND \"prostate cancer\". RESULTS: Lower testosterone levels are associated with better survival and have prognostic significance. Values below 32-20 ng/dl, in accordance to different reported studies, have been established as optimal castration levels with clinical significance, with impact on cancer specific survival and time to castration resistance. Similarly, low PSA levels after starting hormone therapy have been suggested as a strong predictor of survival and treatment response. CONCLUSIONS: Close monitoring of PSA and testosterone levels is necessary in patients with metastatic prostate cancer during hormone deprivation treatment. Combination of both values allows to predict treatment response and early identification of tumor progression, and to put forward subsequent therapeutic strategies improving survival in this group of patients.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 22584031\nTitle: Low testosterone levels are related to poor prognosis factors in men with prostate cancer prior to treatment.\nAuthors: Garcia-Cruz E, Piqueras M, Huguet J\nJournal: BJU international\nPublication Date: 2012 Dec\nAbstract: What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Prostate growth is ruled by testosterone. Nevertheless, the paradigm that high testosterone levels induce prostate cancer development or lead to a poor prognosis in prostate cancer is not supported by evidence. A growing number of studies suggest that, on the contrary, low testosterone levels are related to poor prognosis features in prostate cancer such as higher prostate-specific antigen or higher Gleason score. Our experience shows that testosterone levels are related to risk of progression of prostate cancer - those men with lower testosterone levels are at higher risk of progression of their prostate cancer after treatment delivery. OBJECTIVES: * Low testosterone levels have been related to a higher diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa). Hormonal levels have been related to poor prognosis factors in men with PCa, mainly after radical prostatectomy. * Our aim was to determine the relationship between hormonal levels and PCa prognosis factors in men with PCa prior to the onset of treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: * We prospectively analysed 137 males diagnosed in our centre with PCa with 5+5 core prostate biopsies from February 2007 to December 2009. * As part of our clinical protocol, we performed hormonal determination (testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin) following International Society of Andrology, International Society for the Study of the Aging Male and European Association of Urology recommendations. * Free testosterone and bioavailable testosterone were calculated using Vermeulen's formula. * Age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), free to total PSA, PSA density, number of previous biopsies, digital rectal examination staging, Gleason score, percentage of tumour in the biopsy sample, bilaterality of the tumour and risk of progression group were prospectively recorded. RESULTS: * Higher testosterone levels were related to lower digital rectal examination staging (P= 0.02) and lower PSA level (P= 0.05). Higher testosterone was not related to lower Gleason score (P= 0.08). * Testosterone was inversely related to PCa bilaterality (P < 0.01) and percentage of tumour in the biopsy (P < 0.01). * High testosterone levels were found in patients allocated to the low risk of progression group and inversely (P= 0.03). * In multivariate analysis, higher age and lower testosterone were related to higher D'Amico risk of progression. CONCLUSION: * Patients with PCa and lower testosterone levels have poor prognosis factors and higher tumour burden before treatment onset. These findings reinforce the idea that low testosterone levels pretreatment are related to a poor prognosis in PCa.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 11803262\nTitle: Prostate-specific antigen levels and prognosis in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer treated with low-dose dexamethasone.\nAuthors: Morioka M, Kobayashi T, Furukawa Y\nJournal: Urologia internationalis\nPublication Date: 2002\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE: The efficacy of low-dose dexamethasone (DXM) therapy in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) was evaluated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response and survival following DXM therapy were analyzed in 27 Japanese patients exhibiting HRPC. Concurrent therapies and antiandrogen withdrawal syndrome, which may affect PSA levels and palliative effects, were excluded from the study. A dose of 1.5 mg of DXM was administered, and androgen deprivation therapy was maintained during DXM therapy. A decline in PSA levels of at least 50% from baseline was considered a significant PSA response. Prognostic factors for PSA response and survival were examined by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: A significant PSA response was observed in 16 of the 27 cases (59.3%). Median survival period of patients exhibiting significant PSA response was 15.9 months and was significantly longer than that of patients demonstrating a decline in PSA of less than 50% (median 7.7 months, p < 0.0001). Effect on pain control also correlated with the significant PSA response. No meaningful prognostic factors for PSA response were detected; however, a PSA decline of greater than 50% was the prognostic factor for survival. CONCLUSION: DXM therapy remains one of the most beneficial treatment modalities in patients with HRPC.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients eligible for an 18-F choline positron-emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) were enrolled in a prospective cohort study. Eligible patients had asymptomatic biochemical recurrence after primary PCa treatment and testosterone levels >50 ng/mL. The number of lesions was counted per scan. Patients with isolated local recurrence (LR) or with </=3 metastases (with or without LR) were considered to have low-volume disease and patients with >3 metastases to have high-volume disease. Descriptive statistics were used to report recurrences. Cox regression analysis was used to investigate the influence of prognostic variables on the time to developing castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). RESULTS: In 208 patients, 625 sites of recurrence were detected in the lymph nodes (N1/M1a: 30%), the bone (18%), the prostate (bed; 11%), viscera (4%), or a combination of any of the previous (37%). In total, 153 patients (74%) had low-volume recurrence and 55 patients (26%) had high-volume recurrence. The 3-year CRPC-free survival rate for the whole cohort was 79% (95% confidence interval 43-55), 88% for low-volume recurrences and 50% for high-volume recurrences (P < 0.001). Longer PSA doubling time at time of recurrence and low-volume disease were associated with a longer time to CRPC. CONCLUSIONS: Three out of four patients with PCa with a 18-F choline PET-CT-detected recurrence have low-volume disease, potentially amenable to local therapy. Patients with low-volume disease have a better prognosis as compared with their counterparts. Lymph node recurrence was the most dominant failure pattern.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 38127275\nTitle: Anti-Mullerian hormone: a novel biomarker for aggressive prostate cancer? Emerging evidence from a prospective study of radical prostatectomies.\nAuthors: Kontogiannis S, Markantes G, Stamou M\nJournal: Hormones (Athens, Greece)\nPublication Date: 2024 Jun\nAbstract: PURPOSE: Prostate cancer patients are a heterogeneous group as regards the aggressiveness of the disease. The relationship of steroid hormones with the aggressiveness of prostate cancer is unclear. It is known that the anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) inhibits prostate cancer cell lines in vitro. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship of AMH and steroid hormones with the aggressiveness of prostate cancer. METHODS: This was a prospective study of consecutive radical prostatectomy patients. We measured the following hormones: total testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, albumin, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, estradiol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, androstenedione, and AMH. The minimum follow-up after radical prostatectomy was 5 years. For the aggressiveness of prostate cancer, we considered the following three variables: post-operative Gleason score (GS) >/= 8, TNM pTau3 disease, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) biochemical recurrence (BCR). RESULTS: In total, 91 patients were enrolled. The mean age and PSA were 64.8 years and 9.3 ng/dl, respectively. The median post-operative GS was 7. Low AMH blood levels were correlated with higher post-operative GS (p = 0.001), as well as with PSA BCR (p = 0.043). With pT3 disease, only albumin was (negatively) correlated (p = 0.008). ROC analysis showed that AMH is a good predictor of BCR (AUC 0.646, 95% CI 0.510-0.782, p = 0.043); a cutoff value of 3.06 ng/dl had a positive prognostic value of 71.4% and a negative prognostic value of 63.3% for BCR. Cox regression analysis showed that AMH is a statistically significant and independent prognostic marker for BCR (p = 0.013). More precisely, for every 1 ng/ml of AMH rise, the probability for PSA BCR decreases by 20.8% (HR = 0.792). Moreover, in Kaplan-Meier analysis, disease-free survival is more probable in patients with AMEta >/= 3.06 ng/ml (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Low AMH blood levels were correlated with aggressive prostate cancer in this radical prostatectomy cohort of patients. Therefore, AMH could be a prognostic biomarker for the aggressiveness of the disease.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 21414514\nTitle: Does hormone therapy reduce disease recurrence in prostate cancer patients receiving dose-escalated radiation therapy? An analysis of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 94-06.\nAuthors: Valicenti RK, Bae K, Michalski J\nJournal: International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics\nPublication Date: 2011 Apr 1\nAbstract: PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect on freedom from biochemical failure (bNED) or disease-free survival (DFS) by adding hormone therapy (HT) to dose-escalated radiation therapy (HDRT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: We used 883 analyzable prostate cancer patients who enrolled on Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 94-06, a Phase I/II dose escalation trial, and whose mean planning target volume dose exceeded 73.8 Gy (mean, 78.5 Gy; maximum, 84.3 Gy). We defined biochemical failure according to the Phoenix definition. RESULTS: A total of 259 men started HT 2 to 3 months before HDRT, but not longer than 6 months, and 66 men with high-risk prostate cancer received HT for a longer duration. At 5 years, the biochemical failure rates after HDRT alone were 12%, 18%, and 29% for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients, respectively (p < 0.0001). Cox proportional hazards regression analysis adjusted for covariates revealed that pretreatment PSA level was a significant factor, whereas risk group, Gleason score, T-stage, and age were not. When the patients were stratified by risk groups, the Cox proportion hazards regression model (after adjusting for pretreatment PSA, biopsy Gleason score, and T stage) did not reveal a significant effect on bNED or DFS by adding HT to HDRT CONCLUSION: The addition of HT did not significantly improve bNED survival or DFS in all prostate cancer patients receiving HDRT, but did approach significance in high-risk patient subgroup. The result of this study is hypothesis generating and requires testing in a prospective randomized trial.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

METHODS: One hundred fifty-six men with clinically localized prostate cancer were treated with neoadjuvant combined androgen withdrawal therapy for 8 months prior to radical prostatectomy. Preoperative clinical stage, Gleason score, and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were compared with treatment outcome (pathologic stage and PSA recurrence). RESULTS: PSA at diagnosis was 10 microg/L or higher in 36% with a mean of 11.5 microg/L. Clinical stage was T1c in 18%, T2 in 74%, and T3a in 8%. Gleason score was 6 or lower in 76% and 7 or higher in 24%. Pathologic stage was T0 in 13%, T2 in 66%, T3 (specimen confined) in 13%, T3 (margin positive) in 6%, and TxN+ in 2%. Incidence of positive margins increased with clinical stage T3a versus organ-confined disease (25% versus 4%, P <0.05), pretreatment Gleason scores 7 or higher versus Gleason scores 6 or lower (11% versus 4%, P = NS), and pretreatment PSA levels higher than 10 microg/L compared with PSA levels lower than 10 microg/L (15% versus 0%, P <0.01). Overall PSA recurrence rate was 12.2% after a mean postoperative follow-up of 54 months. Risk of PSA recurrence increased with clinical stage (25% T3 versus 11% organ confined, P <0.01), pretreatment PSA (7% if PSA lower than 10 microg/L versus 21% if 10 microg/L or higher, P <0.02), Gleason score (9% if 6 or lower versus 22% if 7 or higher, P <0.02), and pathologic stage (6% of pT2, 24% of pT3M-, and 56% of pT3M+, P <0.01). PSA recurrences occurred in 6% of patients with no adverse preoperative risk factors, 12% with any one of the high-risk factors, and 29% with any two of the high-risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Risk of PSA recurrence after 8 months of neoadjuvant therapy is low after 5 years of follow-up and remains proportional to the presence of adverse preoperative risk factors. Prospective randomized studies are required to determine whether longer duration of neoadjuvant therapy reduces the risk of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 31100226\nTitle: Optimizing the Timing of Salvage Postprostatectomy Radiotherapy and the Use of Concurrent Hormonal Therapy for Prostate Cancer.\nAuthors: Kishan AU, Tendulkar RD, Tran PT\nJournal: European urology oncology\nPublication Date: 2018 May\nAbstract: CONTEXT: Currently, salvage radiotherapy (SRT) is the only known curative intervention for men with recurrent disease following prostatectomy. Critical issues in the optimal selection and management of men being considered for SRT include the threshold prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value at which to initiate treatment (ie, pre-SRT PSA) and the role of concurrent hormonal therapy (HT). OBJECTIVE: To review the published evidence pertaining to the optimal timing for SRT and the role of concurrent HT. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and guideline statements from professional organizations were queried from January 1, 2000 through January 10, 2018. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Thirty-three independent reports, including two randomized trials evaluating HT with SRT, were identified. Retrospective data suggest that SRT initiation at lower pre-SRT PSA levels is associated with better clinical outcomes. Prospective data suggest an overall survival benefit with concurrent HT that manifests during long-term follow-up, with the caveat that hypothesis-generating subgroup analyses suggest that this benefit may be limited to patients with higher pre-SRT PSA levels. Patients with adverse risk factors, such as Gleason grade group 4-5 disease, are likely to benefit the most from earlier SRT initiation and/or the use of HT. CONCLUSIONS: Given the limitations of the available data, it is imperative that physicians participate in shared decision-making, with the recommendation tailored for each man's desire to maximize oncologic benefit (with a risk of overtreatment) versus potential quality-of-life optimization (with a risk of undertreatment). Within that framework, a significant body of retrospective data supports initiation of SRT at low pre-SRT PSA values, without an arbitrary absolute threshold. Prospective data suggest a benefit of HT, but this benefit may be greatest in patients with a pre-SRT PSA that is higher than the typical level in most patients receiving \"early\" SRT. Further research is necessary before absolute recommendations can be made. PATIENT SUMMARY: Two ways to potentially improve outcomes following salvage radiotherapy for prostate cancer that recurs after prostatectomy are to start treatment at a lower prostate-specific antigen level and to use concurrent hormonal therapy. Our review suggests that the available evidence is imperfect, but highlights that both measures are likely to improve clinical outcomes in general, but perhaps not uniformly and/or consistently for all patients. Physician-patient shared decision-making and further research are critical.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 20002667\nTitle: Long-term data on the survival of patients with prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy in the prostate-specific antigen era.\nAuthors: Isbarn H, Wanner M, Salomon G\nJournal: BJU international\nPublication Date: 2010 Jul\nAbstract: STUDY TYPE: Therapy (case series) Level of Evidence 4. OBJECTIVE: To examine the long-term rates of biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival, cancer-specific mortality (CSM)-free survival, and overall survival (OS) in patients with prostate cancer treated with open radical prostatectomy (RP) in the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) era. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study comprised 436 patients who were treated with RP between 1992 and 1997 at our institution. None received adjuvant/salvage therapy in the absence of BCR. The BCR-free, CSM-free and OS rates were defined using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariable Cox-regression models were used to test the effect of age, preoperative PSA level, neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, pT stage, lymph node status, RP Gleason sum and surgical margin status on BCR. RESULTS: The median follow-up of censored patients was 122, 128, and 132 months for, respectively, BCR-free, CSM-free and OS estimates. The 10-year event-free survival rates for the same endpoints were 60%, 94% and 86%, respectively. Preoperative PSA level, RP Gleason sum, pT stage, lymph node status, and surgical margin status were independent predictors of BCR (all adjusted P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to evaluate the long-term cancer control outcomes after RP from a European country in the PSA era. Our data indicate that RP provides excellent long-term survival rates in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer. Although approximately 40% of patients have BCR after 10 years of follow-up, the CSM rate after 10 years is as low as 6%.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

9-residue peptide analogue of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Unlike the endogenous decapeptide GnRH, leuprolide contains a single D-amino acid (D-leucyl) residue, which helps to increase its circulating half-life from three to four minutes to approximately three hours.[A203222] As a GnRH mimic, leuprolide is capable of binding to the GnRH receptor (GnRHR) and inducing downstream modulation of both gonadotropin hormone and sex steroid levels. Prolonged activation of GnRHR results in significant downregulation of sex steroid levels, which is primarily responsible for the clinical efficacy of leuprolide in diverse conditions, including advanced prostate cancer, endometriosis, and central precocious puberty.[A203126, A203132]\r\n\r\nLeuprolide was first approved in 1985 as a daily subcutaneous injection under the tradename Lupron\u2122 by Abbvie Endocrine Inc.[L13850] Since this initial approval, various long-acting intramuscular and subcutaneous products have been developed such that patients can be dosed once every six months.[L13781, L13790] Leuprolide remains frontline therapy in all conditions for which it is indicated for use.\nBicalutamide: Bicalutamide is an oral non-steroidal anti-androgen for prostate cancer. It is comprised of a racemic mixture that is a 50:50 composition of the (R)-bicalutamide and (S)-bicalutamide enantionmers.

It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nBicalutamide: Bicalutamide is an oral non-steroidal anti-androgen for prostate cancer. It is comprised of a racemic mixture that is a 50:50 composition of the (R)-bicalutamide and (S)-bicalutamide enantionmers.

It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nBicalutamide: Bicalutamide is an oral non-steroidal anti-androgen for prostate cancer.

Unlike the endogenous decapeptide GnRH, leuprolide contains a single D-amino acid (D-leucyl) residue, which helps to increase its circulating half-life from three to four minutes to approximately three hours.[A203222] As a GnRH mimic, leuprolide is capable of binding to the GnRH receptor (GnRHR) and inducing downstream modulation of both gonadotropin hormone and sex steroid levels. Prolonged activation of GnRHR results in significant downregulation of sex steroid levels, which is primarily responsible for the clinical efficacy of leuprolide in diverse conditions, including advanced prostate cancer, endometriosis, and central precocious puberty.[A203126, A203132]\r\n\r\nLeuprolide was first approved in 1985 as a daily subcutaneous injection under the tradename Lupron\u2122 by Abbvie Endocrine Inc.[L13850] Since this initial approval, various long-acting intramuscular and subcutaneous products have been developed such that patients can be dosed once every six months.[L13781, L13790] Leuprolide remains frontline therapy in all conditions for which it is indicated for use.\nBicalutamide: Bicalutamide is an oral non-steroidal anti-androgen for prostate cancer. It is comprised of a racemic mixture that is a 50:50 composition of the (R)-bicalutamide and (S)-bicalutamide enantionmers. Bicalutamide binds to the androgen receptor.\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n",
