platinum-based chemotherapy drug in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nCapecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers. Capecitabine is a prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to fluorouracil (antimetabolite) in the tumor, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor tissue.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

platinum-based chemotherapy drug in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nCapecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers. Capecitabine is a prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to fluorouracil (antimetabolite) in the tumor, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor tissue.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

However, the neoadjuvant and surgical toxicity of this regimen was significant and was the primary reason for the low compliance with adjuvant systemic therapy.Due to the lack of an improvement in the pathologic complete response rate, the substantial associated toxicity, and the negative phase III trials of adjuvant bevacizumab in colon cancer, this regimen will not be pursued for further study. BACKGROUND: The addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy improves overall survival for metastatic colorectal cancer. We initiated a phase II trial to evaluate preoperative capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab with radiation therapy (RT) followed by surgery and postoperative 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin (FOLFOX), and bevacizumab for locally advanced rectal cancer. The purpose of this report is to describe the 5-year oncologic outcomes of this regimen. METHODS: In a phase II Simon two-stage design study, we evaluated preoperative treatment with capecitabine (825 mg/m(2) b.i.d. Monday-Friday), oxaliplatin (50 mg/m(2) weekly), bevacizumab (5 mg/kg on days 1, 15, and 29), and RT (50.4 Gy). Surgery was performed by 8 weeks after RT. Beginning 8-12 weeks after surgery, patients received FOLFOX plus bevacizumab (5 mg/kg) every 2 weeks for 12 cycles (oxaliplatin stopped after 9 cycles). The primary endpoint was a pathologic complete response (path-CR) rate of 30%. Fifty-seven patients with resectable T3/T4 rectal adenocarcinoma were enrolled between 2006 and 2010. RESULTS: Of 57 enrolled patients, 53 were eligible and included in the analysis. Forty-eight (91%) patients completed preoperative therapy, all of whom underwent curative surgical resection. Nine patients (17%) achieved path-CR. There were 29 worst grade 3 events, 8 worst grade 4 events, and 2 patient deaths, 1 of which was attributed to study therapy. Twenty-six patients (54%) began adjuvant chemotherapy. After a median follow-up period of 41 months, the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate for all patients was 80%. Only 2 patients experienced cancer recurrence: 1 distant (liver) and 1 loco-regional (pelvic lymph nodes), respectively. Both of these patients are still alive. The 5-year relapse-free survival rate was 81%. CONCLUSION: Despite the path-CR primary endpoint of this trial not being reached, the 5-year OS and recurrence-free survival rates were excellent. However, the neoadjuvant and surgical toxicity of this regimen was significant and was the primary reason for the low compliance with adjuvant systemic therapy. Because of the lack of an improvement in the path-CR rate, the substantial associated toxicity, and the negative phase III trials of adjuvant bevacizumab in colon cancer, this regimen will not be pursued for further study.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 36967268\nTitle: Incidence of Disease Recurrence in Patients With Colon and Upper Rectum Adenocarcinoma Stage II and III Receiving Adjuvant Capecitabine Monotherapy: Do Number of Chemotherapy Cycles and Relative Dose Intensity of the Drug Play a Role?\nAuthors: Sgouros J, Gkoura S, Spathas N\nJournal: Clinical colorectal cancer\nPublication Date: 2023 Jun\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND: Adjuvant capecitabine monotherapy is an option for colon and upper rectum adenocarcinoma patients, providing they have stage II disease with an intermediate risk of recurrence, or stage III but they are above 70's or they have comorbidities. We wanted to examine whether the number of chemotherapy cycles and the relative dose intensity (RDI) of capecitabine monotherapy in the adjuvant setting are affecting disease recurrence. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included patients with completely resected stage II and III colon and upper rectum cancer who received adjuvant capecitabine monotherapy, from 2003 until May 2020. Patients with early relapse, i.e. during chemotherapy or within 6 months after the completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, and those with rectal cancer who received radiotherapy were excluded. Patients were divided into 3 groups based on the number of chemotherapy cycles received and the RDI. Group A included patients with </=4 cycles of chemotherapy, group B patients with >4 cycles of chemotherapy and RDI </=80%, and group C patients with >4 cycles of chemotherapy and RDI >80%. Study's endpoint, was recurrence free survival (RFS). RESULTS: Two hundred twenty six patients with stage II and III disease (164 and 62 respectively) were included. Sixteen, 166 and 44 were included in groups A, B and C respectively. After a median follow-up of 41 months, 21 patients (9,3%) had relapsed. Patients belonging to group C were found to have a trend for lower relapse rate compared to patients belonging to group A or group B. CONCLUSION: Number of adjuvant capecitabine cycles and RDI might play a role in RFS in patients with stage II and III colon and upper rectum adenocarcinoma.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 30538378\nTitle: Chemo-Radiation After Upfront Rectal Resections-a Clinical Dilemma.\nAuthors: Saklani A, Sugoor P, Bhandare M\nJournal: Indian journal of surgical oncology\nPublication Date: 2018 Dec\nAbstract: To compare the impact of adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy (ACRT) versus adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) alone on recurrence and survival in patients with stage II and III rectal adenocarcinoma undergoing upfront curative resection. Prospective observational review of colorectal database at Tata Memorial Hospital from July 2010 to March 2015 identified 84 patients who underwent upfront curative resection for stage II or III rectal cancer. None of the patient received preoperative chemo-radiation. Of these, adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy was administered to 29 patients (ACRT group) and 55 patients received CAPEOX/FOLFOX-based adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT group) alone. At a median follow-up of 20 months, there were 10 recurrences (3 local recurrence) in the ACRT group and 15 (2 local recurrence) in ACT group. The estimated disease-free survival at 3 years in the ACRT group was 62.7% and in ACT group was 49.7% (p = 0.417) with an estimated 3-year overall survival of 74 and 78% in the ACRT and ACT group, respectively (p = 0.241). Subgroup analysis was performed after risk stratifying prognostic features (pT4, pN2, poor differentiation, involved resection margin). Our study does not show any benefit of ACRT over ACT on local control, disease-free and overall survival after upfront rectal cancer resection for low-risk stage II-III. In the subgroup analysis, local recurrence did not occur in patients who did not have poor prognostic features irrespective whether they received ACRT or ACT. Adjuvant chemo-radiation can be avoided in low-risk stage II-III rectal cancer after upfront resection.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nCapecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers. Capecitabine is a prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to fluorouracil (antimetabolite) in the tumor, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor tissue.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

platinum-based chemotherapy drug in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nCapecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers.

On the basis of review of the current guidelines and literature, we have developed actualized clinical and molecular prognostic factors of recurrence, progression and cancer specific survival (CSS) in patients with HRBC. RECENT FINDINGS: A Medline search was conducted to identify the current literature updating the most important clinic and pathological predictive factors published in the last years. Also, there have been reviewed the new molecular markers that can assess prognosis and BCG response. SUMMARY: Despite different methodological bias, as short follow-up, a small number of patients and a different definition of prognostic factors, increased evidence supports sex, age, grade, stage, multifocality, history of previous recurrences, carcinoma in situ in the prostatic urethra and early recurrence as prognostic factors for recurrence, progression and CSS in nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer. Also lymphovascular invasion in TUR and new molecular markers (galectin-3, profilin-1, and combination of markers) are increasingly useful in predicting prognosis and BCG response. Moreover, there is enough evidence to consider the implementation of new specific risk tables for patients treated with BCG. In cases with poor prognostic factors after TUR in HRBC early cystectomy should be considered.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 22116540\nTitle: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in cancer progression and survival: a systematic review.\nAuthors: Mc Menamin UC, Murray LJ, Cantwell MM\nJournal: Cancer causes & control : CCC\nPublication Date: 2012 Feb\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and disease progression and survival in cancer patients. METHODS: Using terms for cancer and ACEIs/ARBs, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science were systematically searched for observational/interventional studies that used clinically relevant outcomes for cancer progression and survival. RESULTS: Ten studies met the inclusion criteria. Two studies showed a significant improvement in overall survival (OS) with ACEI/ARB use among patients with advanced pancreatic (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.29-0.88) and non-small cell lung cancer (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.33-0.95). An improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) was also reported for pancreatic cancer patients (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.34-0.95) and patients with renal cell carcinoma (HR 0.54, p = 0.02). ACEI/ARB use was protective against breast cancer recurrence (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.37-0.96), colorectal cancer distant metastasis (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.08-0.65) and prostate specific antigen (PSA) failure in prostate cancer patients (p = 0.034). One study observed a worse OS (HR 2.01, 95% CI 1.00-4.05) and PFS in ACEI users with multiple myeloma (p = 0.085) while another reported an increased risk of breast cancer recurrence (HR = 1.56, 95% CI 1.02-2.39). CONCLUSION: There is some evidence to suggest that ACEI or ARB use may be associated with improved outcomes in cancer patients. Larger, more robust studies are required to explore this relationship further.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 25443267\nTitle: Treatment and survival in patients with recurrent high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.\nAuthors: Chamie K, Ballon-Landa E, Daskivich TJ\nJournal: Urologic oncology\nPublication Date: 2015 Jan\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Multiple recurrences develop in patients with high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. As neither the association of recurrences with survival nor the subsequent aggressive treatment in individuals with recurrent high-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer has ever been quantified, we sought to determine whether the increasing number of recurrences is associated with higher subsequent treatment and mortality rates. METHODS: Using linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data, we identified subjects with recurrent high-grade, non-muscle-invasive disease diagnosed in 1992 to 2002 and followed up until 2007. Using competing-risks regression analyses, we quantified the incidence of radical cystectomy, radiotherapy, and systemic chemotherapy after each recurrence. We then performed a propensity-score adjusted competing-risks regression analysis to determine whether the increasing recurrences portend worse survival. RESULTS: Of 4,521 subjects, 2,694 (59.6%) had multiple recurrences within 2 years of diagnosis. Compared with patients who only had 1 recurrence, those with >/= 4 recurrences were less likely to undergo radical cystectomy (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.58-0.92), yet more likely to undergo radiotherapy (HR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.23-1.85) and systemic chemotherapy (HR = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.15-2.18). For patients with >/= 4 recurrences, only 25% were treated with curative intent. The 10-year cancer-specific mortality rates were 6.9%, 9.7%, 13.7%, and 15.7% for those with 1, 2, 3, and >/= 4 recurrences, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Only 25% of patients with high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer who experienced recurrences at least 4 times underwent radical cystectomy or radiotherapy. Despite portending worse outcomes, increasing recurrences do not necessarily translate into higher treatment rates.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

platinum-based chemotherapy drug in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nCapecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers. Capecitabine is a prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to fluorouracil (antimetabolite) in the tumor, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor tissue.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: timeline1.txt] included in your context\nAGE: 61.915, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: Yes, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 61.915, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has progressed.\nAGE: 61.915, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), CT, TUMOR_SITE: Lymph Nodes, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 61.915, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), CT, TUMOR_SITE: Lung, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 61.934, labtest > cea_labs --> CEA: 6.7000 ng/ml          \nAGE: 61.956, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: Indeterminate, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: PET, HAS_CANCER: Indeterminate, PROCEDURE_TYPE: PET, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: Yes, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 61.956, diagnosis > progression --> PROGRESSION: N, PROCEDURE_TYPE: PET, \nAGE: 61.980, samples > clinical_sample --> SAMPLE_ID: P-0040042-T01-IM6, PATIENT_ID: P-0040042, PDL1_POSITIVE: Yes, CANCER_TYPE: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, SAMPLE_TYPE: Primary, SAMPLE_CLASS: Tumor, METASTATIC_SITE: Not Applicable, PRIMARY_SITE: Lung, CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED: Lung Adenosquamous Carcinoma, GENE_PANEL: IMPACT468, SAMPLE_COVERAGE: 597, TUMOR_PURITY: 30.0, ONCOTREE_CODE: LUAS, MSI_COMMENT: MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

and proliferation of cancer cells.[A192939,A192837,A192891,A193275] VEGF plays an important role in angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, and tumor growth, which are all factors that contribute to its attractiveness as a therapeutic target for anti-cancer therapies.[A192834,A192888,A192837,A192891,A192894] \r\n\r\nIn 2004, bevacizumab (Avastin) gained FDA approval for specific types of cancer, and became the first antiangiogenic agent introduced to the market.[A193272,A193275] It is a humanized monoclonal IgG antibody, and inhibits angiogenesis by binding and neutralizing VEGF-A.[A192888,A192939] Bevacizumab is generally indicated for use in combination with different chemotherapy regimens which are specific to the type, severity, and stage of cancer.[L12648] Bevacizumab was approved by Health Canada on March 24, 2010 and by the European Commission on April 21, 2021.[L45793,L43130] There are several biosimilars of bevacizumab, such as bevacizumab-awwb, bevacizumab-maly, bevacizumab-adcd, and bevacizumab-tnjn. \r\n\r\nInterestingly, researchers have identified higher VEGF expression in patients with COVID-19, which may contribute to lung pathologies including acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI).[L12699] As such, bevacizumab is being investigated for the treatment of lung complications associated with severe cases of COVID-19.[L12699]\nCapecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers. Capecitabine is a prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to fluorouracil (antimetabolite) in the tumor, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor tissue.\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nMegestrol: nan\n]\n",
