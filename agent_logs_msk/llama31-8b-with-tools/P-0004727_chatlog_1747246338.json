chemotherapy drug in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

In this study, we identified prognostic factors for survival and recurrence in patients with histologically proven pancreatic adenocarcinoma. METHODOLOGY: Between January 2003 and December 2009, 82 patients with histologically proven pancreatic adenocarcinoma were considered for this study. Follow-up consisted of personal contact with patients or review of electronic medical records at this center and was terminated on December 31, 2011 or upon the patient's death. RESULTS: Overall survival rates of all patients at 1, 3, and 5 years were 51.9, 21.6 and 16.0%. Preoperative jaundice was the only independent prognostic factor for total pancreatic cancer patients, while N stage and perineural invasion in pathological findings was identified as an independent prognostic factor for survival of patients with surgical resection. Chemotherapy was the only independent prognostic factor for survival of patients who underwent palliative surgical bypass. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative jaundice in any patients, lymph node metastasis, perineural invasion in patients with surgical resection, and chemotherapy in patients undergoing palliative surgical bypass are important prognostic factors for survival of pancreatic cancer.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 30945087\nTitle: Clinicopathological Features, Recurrence Patterns, and Prognosis of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma with Normal Serum CA19-9. A Consecutive Series of 154 Cases from a Single Institute.\nAuthors: Zhao Y, Wang C\nJournal: Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract\nPublication Date: 2020 Apr\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Serum levels of CA19-9 correlate with recurrence and survival in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma; however, little is known about the features and prognosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma with normal CA19-9 levels. METHOD: Patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (n = 806) were split into two groups with normal (</= 37 U/mL) and elevated (> 37 U/mL) CA19-9. The clinicopathological features, survival, and recurrence patterns were compared between two groups. We also sought to identify factors that best predicted prognosis in pancreatic adenocarcinoma with normal CA19-9 levels, to assist in the selection of the most effective adjuvant treatment. RESULTS: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma with normal CA19-9 were less likely to have lymph node metastasis, angiolymphatic invasion, intrapancreatic neural invasion, anterior serosal invasion, and invasion of the surrounding tissue/organ (distal bile duct, duodenum, or splenic artery or vein). Following propensity-score matching, pancreatic adenocarcinoma with normal CA19-9 levels (</= 37 U/ml) were associated with significantly superior overall survival following resection. Moreover, the CA19-9 </= 37 U/mL group demonstrated a significantly lower rate of local recurrence (35.57% vs. 52.35%, p = 0.004), distant recurrence (42.95% vs. 60.4%, p = 0.003), and mixed recurrence (5.37% vs. 29.53%, p < 0.000) compared with the CA19-9 > 37 U/mL group. Multivariate analysis suggested that angiolymphatic invasion, lymph node metastases, and tumor size > 3 cm were independent prognostic factors for pancreatic adenocarcinoma with normal CA19-9. Survival analyses suggested that post-op chemoradiotherapy or chemotherapy were associated with more favorable outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma with normal pretreatment CA19-9 levels (</= 37 U/ml) were characterized by better biological characteristics, reduced rates of recurrence, and longer overall survival. Moreover, optimal adjuvant therapy should be performed after surgery.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 37658871\nTitle: Prognostic factor in patient with recurrent pancreatic adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Sumiyoshi T, Uemura K, Shintakuya R\nJournal: Langenbeck's archives of surgery\nPublication Date: 2023 Sep 2\nAbstract: PURPOSE: To elucidate prognostic factors for post-recurrence survival in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). METHODS: Patients who underwent curative-intent surgery for PDAC between January 2014 and May 2020 were identified. Among them, patients who had postoperative recurrences and received chemotherapy were retrospectively investigated. Independent prognostic factors for survival after recurrence were investigated using multivariate analyses. Eligible patients were divided into two groups according to the presence or absence of the identified prognostic factors, and survival times after recurrence were compared. RESULTS: Eighty-four patients with recurrent PDAC were included. Multivariate analysis showed that red blood cell (RBC) transfusion (HR, 2.80; p = 0.0051), low albumin level (HR, 1.84; p = 0.0402), and high carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) level at recurrence (HR, 2.11; p = 0.0258) were significant predictors of shorter survival after recurrence. The median survival times after recurrence in the transfusion and non-transfusion groups were 5.5 vs. 18.1 months (p < 0.0001), respectively; those in the low and normal albumin groups were 10.1 vs. 18.7 months (p = 0.0049), and those in the high and normal CA19-9 groups were 11.5 vs. 22.6 months (p = 0.0023), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: RBC transfusion, low albumin, and high CA19-9 levels at recurrence negatively affected survival after recurrence in patients with PDAC.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: timeline0.txt] included in your context\nAGE: 60.463, samples > clinical_sample --> SAMPLE_ID:
