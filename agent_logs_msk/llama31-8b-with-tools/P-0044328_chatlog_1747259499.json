This randomized, double-blind, phase III study investigated the efficacy and safety of first-line ipilimumab or placebo plus paclitaxel and carboplatin in advanced squamous NSCLC. Patients and Methods Patients with stage IV or recurrent chemotherapy-naive squamous NSCLC were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive paclitaxel and carboplatin plus blinded ipilimumab 10 mg/kg or placebo every 3 weeks on a phased induction schedule comprising six chemotherapy cycles, with ipilimumab or placebo from cycles 3 to 6 and then, after induction treatment, ipilimumab or placebo maintenance every 12 weeks for patients with stable disease or better. The primary end point was overall survival (OS) in patients receiving at least one dose of blinded study therapy. Results Of 956 randomly assigned patients, 749 received at least one dose of blinded study therapy (chemotherapy plus ipilimumab, n = 388; chemotherapy plus placebo, n = 361). Median OS was 13.4 months for chemotherapy plus ipilimumab and 12.4 months for chemotherapy plus placebo (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.07; P = .25). Median progression-free survival was 5.6 months for both groups (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.01). Rates of grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), any-grade serious TRAEs, and TRAEs leading to discontinuation were numerically higher with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab (51%, 33%, and 28%, respectively) than with chemotherapy plus placebo (35%, 10%, and 7%, respectively). Seven treatment-related deaths occurred with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab, and one occurred with chemotherapy plus placebo. Conclusion The addition of ipilimumab to first-line chemotherapy did not prolong OS compared with chemotherapy alone in patients with advanced squamous NSCLC. The safety profile of chemotherapy plus ipilimumab was consistent with that observed in previous lung and melanoma studies. Ongoing studies are evaluating ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab in this population.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 33184754\nTitle: Randomized phase II trial of carboplatin + nab-paclitaxel versus cisplatin + gemcitabine for chemotherapy-naive squamous cell carcinoma: North Japan lung cancer study group 1302.\nAuthors: Kawashima Y, Harada T, Fujita Y\nJournal: International journal of clinical oncology\nPublication Date: 2021 Mar\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: A subset analysis of the CA031 trial showed significant improvement in the overall response rate after administration of carboplatin plus weekly albumin-bound paclitaxel compared to carboplatin plus paclitaxel for squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (SQ). We conducted this phase II study to compare carboplatin plus weekly albumin-bound paclitaxel (CnP) to cisplatin plus gemcitabine (CG), a standard regimen for SQ. METHODS: Chemotherapy-naive patients with SQ were randomly assigned to receive cisplatin (80 mg/m(2)) on day 1 plus gemcitabine (1000 mg/m(2)) on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks or carboplatin (area under the curve: 6 mg/mL/min) on day 1 plus nab-paclitaxel (75 mg/m(2)) on days 1, 8, and 15 every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was overall response rate. The secondary endpoints were progression-free survival, overall survival, disease control rate, and toxicity. RESULTS: Between June 2013 and October 2018, 71 patients were enrolled and assigned to either the CG arm (n = 35) or the CnP arm (n = 36) of the study. The overall response rate was 43% [95% confidence interval (CI) 27.3-58.5] in the CG arm and 47% (95% CI 31.7-62.7) in the CnP arm. Although drug combination efficacies did not differ, there were differences in toxicity: hematologic toxicities (leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) were found mostly in the CG arm, whereas anemia and sensory neuropathy were more common in the CnP arm. CONCLUSIONS: CnP had similar response as CG despite being a carboplatin-based regimen and toxicities differed between arms. Regarding ORR, CnP was comparable to CG for SQ.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 34376631\nTitle: Outcomes in 36 Patients with Stage IIIA-N2 Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Lung Treated with Nab-Paclitaxel Plus Carboplatin as Neoadjuvant Therapy: A Prospective Study from a Single Center.\nAuthors: Zhu J, Zhang Y, Wang M\nJournal: Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research\nPublication Date: 2021 Aug 11\nAbstract: BACKGROUND Whether nab-paclitaxel plus carboplatin as neoadjuvant therapy can benefit patients with resectable squamous cell carcinoma of the lung remains unclear. This prospective study aimed to investigate outcomes in patients with stage IIIA-N2 squamous cell carcinoma of the lung treated with nab-paclitaxel plus carboplatin as neoadjuvant therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients with stage IIIA-N2 squamous cell carcinoma of the lung were treated with nab-paclitaxel (100 mg/m(2), days 1, 8, and 15) and carboplatin (5 mg/(mL.min), day 1) for two 21-day cycles. The patients were followed every 3 months for 2 years and every 6 months after that. The primary endpoint was the downstaging rate. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), margin-free (R0) resection, pathologic complete response (pCR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. RESULTS Among the 36 enrolled patients, 33 completed neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and 23 underwent surgery. The preoperative ORR was 50.0% (18/36). R0 resection was achieved in 22 (95.7%) of 23 patients. Major pathologic response and pCR were achieved in 8 (34.8%) and 2 (8.7%) patients, respectively. The overall downstaging rate was 47.8% (11/23). The median follow-up was 39.8 (32.5-41.0) months. For patients who underwent surgery, the median PFS and OS were 31.4 (95%CI: 10.4-not reached (NR)) and 45.0 (95%CI: 22.6-NR) months, respectively. The most common adverse events were neutropenia, anemia, and leukopenia. CONCLUSIONS This study preliminarily indicated a favorable effect of nab-paclitaxel plus carboplatin as neoadjuvant therapy without significant adverse events for stage IIIA-N2 squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Future randomized controlled trials are needed to verify these results.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
