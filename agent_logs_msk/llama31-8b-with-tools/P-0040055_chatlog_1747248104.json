METHODS: A total of 128 lung adenocarcinoma patients with MPE were randomly divided into two groups. Patients in the treatment group were treated with pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2), i.v., d 1, cisplatin intracavitary administration with a total dose of 75 mg/m(2), d 2, 5 and 8, and endostar intracavitary administration 45 mg, d 1, 4 and 7. Patients in the control group were treated with chemotherapy alone (pemetrexed and cisplatin and mode of administration were the same as for the treatment group. RESULTS: The effective rates (ER) of the treatment group and control group were 81.82 and 64.52%, respectively (x(2)=4.906, p=0.027). The MPE control rates (DCRs) were 93.94 and 79.03%, respectively (x(2)=6.168, p=0.013). The control rate of the treatment group was higher compared with the control group (p<0.05), especially during the first period when it was 54.55% (p=0.019); in addition, the recurrence rate was lower (9.68 vs 30.61%, p=0.005). Dyspnea, mood and overall health improved significantly in the treatment group patients. No statistically significant differences in side effects between the groups were noticed. CONCLUSION: Intracavity endostar combined with intracavitary and i.v. pemetrexed and cisplatin had a significant effect on advanced MPE of lung adenocarcinoma. In addition, the quality of life (QoL) was significantly improved and the side effects were tolerable.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 21219833\nTitle: [Pemetrexed combined with cisplatin or carboplatin regimen in the treatment of advanced recurrent or metastasis non-small cell lung cancer: analysis of 63 cases].\nAuthors: Wang W, Shang L, Li X\nJournal: Zhongguo fei ai za zhi = Chinese journal of lung cancer\nPublication Date: 2011 Jan\nAbstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Since the poor outcome for advanced lung cancer with first-line chemotherapy, more efforts should be paid for treatment of advanced recurrent or metastasis non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Pemetrexed, as a multi-target antifolate chemotherapeutic drug, was approved for the second-line treatment of advanced NSCLC. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and side effects of pemetrexed combined with cisplatin/carboplatin in the treatment of advanced recurrent or metastasis NSCLC. METHODS: Sixty-three advanced recurrent or metastasis NSCLC patients confirmed with pathology or cytology were enrolled in this study. Among them, 40 cases were male and 23 were female, with 62 years of median age. The combination regimen was patients received pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) on day 1 and cisplatin 30 mg/m(2) on day 1, day 2 and day 3 or carboplatin 300 mg/m(2) on day 1 by intravenous infusion, with 21 days as one cycle. All patients who received 2 or more cycles could be evaluated. RESULTS: Only 1 case got complete response, with 5 cases partial response, 36 stable and 21 cases progressive. The overall control rate was 66.7% (42/63). The median survival time was 9.0 months, while the median progression-free survival was 5.0 months (3.0 months in squamous cell carcinoma; 5.5 months in adenocarcinoma). There was a significant difference between squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma (P=0.017). The common adverse effects were leucopenia, anemia and gastrointestinal response. CONCLUSIONS: Pemetrexed combined with cisplatin/carboplatin is effective and feasible for advanced recurrent or metastasis NSCLC.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 21970659\nTitle: An indirect comparison of the efficacy of bevacizumab plus carboplatin and paclitaxel versus pemetrexed with cisplatin in patients with advanced or recurrent non-squamous adenocarcinoma non-small cell lung cancer.\nAuthors: Nuijten MJ, Aultman R, Carpeno Jde C\nJournal: Current medical research and opinion\nPublication Date: 2011 Nov\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE: There are two new treatment options available for the treatment of adenocarcinoma histology non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) which offer improved benefit in terms of progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) over chemotherapy. Both bevacizumab and pemetrexed when combined with chemotherapy significantly increase PFS and OS in patients with advanced NSCLC versus chemotherapy alone. The aim of this analysis was to compare the efficacy for patients with non-squamous adenocarcinoma NSCLC treated with bevacizumab, carboplatin and paclitaxel (BCP) to pemetrexed and cisplatin (PC) by using indirect comparison (ITC) methodology. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In the absence of head-to-head trials, ITC was performed on patients with adenocarcinoma histology non-squamous NSCLC to compare the relative benefit of first-line therapies BCP vs. PC by hazard ratios (HR). Subsequently, these HRs were used in a decision-analytic Markov model with a lifelong time horizon to extrapolate the long-term effectiveness of the two treatments. RESULTS: ITC estimated HRs for the primary endpoints in the bevacizumab study E4599 showed that BCP treatment in non-squamous adenocarcinoma NSCLC patients resulted in a BCP HR of 0.82 versus PC. The long-term predictions from the Markov model yielded a mean survival of 1.48 years (95% CI 1.34, 1.62 years) (or 17.7 months) for BCP compared with 1.29 years (95% CI 1.16, 1.42 years) (or 15.4 months) for PC. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our decision analysis, triplet BCP targeted therapy in patients with advanced non-squamous adenocarcinoma NSCLC compared with doublet PC chemotherapy results in improved expected values for overall long-term survival. Therefore, from the efficacy perspective, bevacizumab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy can be considered as the targeted therapy of choice for patients with advanced non-squamous adenocarcinoma NSCLC.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Bevacizumab (B) in combination with carboplatin (C) and paclitaxel (P) improves survival for advanced, nonsquamous NSCLC, as evidenced in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 4599. We conducted a subset analysis of ECOG 4599 to determine the outcome for elderly patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: ECOG 4599 randomly assigned patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC to PC or to PCB. We analyzed outcome in patients who were at least 70 years of age at the time of study entry. Patient characteristics, efficacy, and toxicity data were compared between PC and PCB for the elderly. Outcomes for elderly and younger patients (< 70 years) treated with PCB were also compared. RESULTS: Among elderly patients (n = 224; 26%), there was a trend towards higher response rate (29% v 17%; P = .067) and progression-free survival (5.9 v 4.9 months; P = .063) with PCB compared with PC, although overall survival (PCB = 11.3 months; PC = 12.1 months; P = .4) was similar. Grade 3 to 5 toxicities occurred in 87% of elderly patients with PCB versus 61% with PC (P < .001), with seven treatment-related deaths in the PCB arm compared with two with PC. Elderly patients had higher incidence of grade 3 to 5 neutropenia, bleeding, and proteinuria with PCB compared with younger patients. CONCLUSION: In elderly NSCLC patients, PCB was associated with a higher degree of toxicity, but no obvious improvement in survival compared with PC. Data from this unplanned, retrospective analysis justify prospective evaluation of the therapeutic index of PCB regimen in elderly patients.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of 114 patients who experienced regional LN recurrence as the first recurrence after lung SBRT were retrospectively reviewed. Patterns of recurrence were classified as local recurrence, regional recurrence, and distant metastasis. Clinical outcomes including progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. RESULTS: Half of the patients had regional LN recurrence only. The most common simultaneous recurrence was distant metastasis (38.6 %). Common sites of regional recurrence were ipsilateral hilar (47.2 %), ipsilateral upper mediastinal (40.6 %), and subcarinal (42.5 %) LN stations. 24 (21.1 %) patients underwent salvage radiation therapy (RT), and 44 (38.6 %) patients underwent palliative treatment. Better OS was observed in the salvage RT group (p = 0.025). The 1-year PFS and OS rates were 27.7 % and 55.2 %, respectively, with salvage RT, 14.0 % and 39.9 %, respectively, with palliative treatment, and 22.8 % and 26.8 %, respectively, with no additional treatment. Multivariate analysis showed that salvage RT (PFS, HR 0.463, p = 0.050; OS, HR 0.312, p = 0.002), palliative treatment (PFS, HR 0.436, p = 0.013; OS, HR 0.553, p = 0.050), and simultaneous distant metastasis (PFS, HR 2.335, p = 0.005; OS, HR 1.726, p = 0.054) affected clinical outcomes. CONCLUSION: Many cases of regional LN recurrence are confined to the locoregional area of patients, and appropriate treatment can improve the prognosis of these patients.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 38414316\nTitle: Prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer with postoperative regional lymph node recurrence.\nAuthors: Ohtaki Y, Nagashima T, Okano N\nJournal: Thoracic cancer\nPublication Date: 2024 Apr\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Regional lymph node recurrence after radical surgery for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is an oligo-recurrent disease; however, no treatment strategy has been established. In the present study we aimed to determine the clinical outcomes of postoperative regional lymph node recurrence and identify prognostic predictors in the era of molecular-targeted therapy. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data on clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with regional lymph node recurrence after surgery who underwent treatment for NSCLC between 2002 and 2022. RESULTS: A total of 53 patients were included in this study. The median time between surgery and detection of recurrence was 1.21 years. Radiotherapy (RT) alone and chemoradiotherapy (CRT) were performed in 38 and six patients, respectively. Driver gene alterations were detected in eight patients (EGFR: 6, ROS1:1, and BRAF: 1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression was examined in 22 patients after 2016. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) after lymph node recurrences were 1.32 and 4.34 years, respectively. Multiple lymph node recurrence was an independent prognostic factor for PFS, whereas driver gene alteration was the only prognostic factor for OS. There was no significant difference in the OS between patients stratified according to the initial treatment modality for lymph node recurrence. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the number of tumor recurrences may correlate with PFS, while detection of driver gene alterations could guide decision-making for the appropriate molecular-targeted therapy to achieve longer OS.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 37979334\nTitle: Presentation and outcomes of KRAS(G12C) mutant non-small cell lung cancer patients with stage IV disease at diagnosis (de novo) versus at recurrence.\nAuthors: Esfahanian N, Chan SWS, Zhan LJ\nJournal: Cancer treatment and research communications\nPublication Date: 2023\nAbstract: Close monitoring after diagnosis of patients with stage I-III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) may result in fitter patients with lower disease burden at the time of metastatic recurrence or progression compared to patients diagnosed initially as stage IV (de novo). We compared the presentation, treatments, and outcomes of patients with KRAS(G12C)-mutated NSCLC with de novo versus recurrent stage IV disease. Of 109 patients, 94% had a smoking history. When compared to patients with KRAS(G12C)-mutated NSCLC who developed stage IV disease at recurrence (n = 38), de novo stage IV patients (n = 71) had worse ECOG performance status (p = 0.007), greater numbers of extra-thoracic metastatic sites (p = 0.001), and were less likely to receive 2nd/3rd line systemic therapy (p = 0.05, p = 0.002) or targeted therapy (p = 0.001). De novo metastatic patients had shorter overall survival than metastatic patients at recurrence (9.1 versus 24.2 months; adjusted-hazard-ratio=1.94 (95% CI: 1.14-3.28; p = 0.01)). There is a critical need for well-tolerated targeted therapies in the first-line setting for metastatic patients with de novo, high-burden, stage IV KRAS(G12C)-mutated NSCLCs.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
