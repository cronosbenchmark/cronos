METHODS: We created a decision analytic model comparing the costs and effects of platinum combination chemotherapy with personalized therapy in which patients with EGFR mutation-positive tumors were treated with erlotinib. We used two testing strategies: testing only those with tissue available and performing a repeat biopsy if tissue was not available versus three nontargeted chemotherapy regimens (ie, carboplatin and paclitaxel; carboplatin and pemetrexed; and carboplatin, pemetrexed, and bevacizumab). RESULTS: Compared with a carboplatin plus paclitaxel regimen, targeted therapy based on testing available tissue yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $110,644 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), and the rebiopsy strategy yielded an ICER of $122,219 per QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed substantial uncertainty around these point estimates. With a willingness to pay of $100,000 per QALY, the testing strategy was cost effective 58% of the time, and the rebiopsy strategy was cost effective 54% of the time. Personalized therapy with an EGFR TKI was more favorable when the nontargeted chemotherapy regimen was more expensive. Compared with carboplatin, pemetrexed, and bevacizumab, ICERs were $25,547 per QALY for the testing strategy and $44,036 per QALY for the rebiopsy strategy. CONCLUSION: Although specific clinical circumstances should guide therapy, our cost-effectiveness analysis supports the strategy of testing for EGFR mutations in patients with stage IV or recurrent adenocarcinoma of the lung, rebiopsying patients if insufficient tissue is available for testing, and treating patients with EGFR mutations with erlotinib as first-line therapy.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 35578359\nTitle: Complete remission of an early-stage laryngeal cancer under combined pembrolizumab and chemotherapy treatment of a synchronous lung adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Linxweiler M, Kuhn JP, Neubert C\nJournal: Journal of otolaryngology - head & neck surgery = Le Journal d'oto-rhino-laryngologie et de chirurgie cervico-faciale\nPublication Date: 2022 May 16\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Anti-PD1-Checkpoint inhibition (CI) is an established treatment of recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck cancer. A potential benefit from CI in early-stage disease that is usually treated by radiation or surgery has not been investigated so far and is currently not addressed in clinical trials. CASE PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old man was diagnosed with a cT2 supraglottic laryngeal cancer and a synchronous metastasized adenocarcinoma of the lung. As the patient refused any treatment of his laryngeal cancer, he received combined immune-chemotherapy according to the KEYNOTE-189 protocol. After 4 cycles of pembrolizumab/carboplatin/pemetrexed, the patient showed a complete remission of his laryngeal cancer with a clear shrinkage of the mediastinal and hilar lung cancer metastases. After 21 cycles of maintenance therapy, the lung adenocarcinoma shows a stable disease status with no signs of any residual or recurrent laryngeal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-PD1-CI may be a treatment option also for early-stage HNSCC with excellent functional outcome when established therapies are not available.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 21970659\nTitle: An indirect comparison of the efficacy of bevacizumab plus carboplatin and paclitaxel versus pemetrexed with cisplatin in patients with advanced or recurrent non-squamous adenocarcinoma non-small cell lung cancer.\nAuthors: Nuijten MJ, Aultman R, Carpeno Jde C\nJournal: Current medical research and opinion\nPublication Date: 2011 Nov\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE: There are two new treatment options available for the treatment of adenocarcinoma histology non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) which offer improved benefit in terms of progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) over chemotherapy. Both bevacizumab and pemetrexed when combined with chemotherapy significantly increase PFS and OS in patients with advanced NSCLC versus chemotherapy alone. The aim of this analysis was to compare the efficacy for patients with non-squamous adenocarcinoma NSCLC treated with bevacizumab, carboplatin and paclitaxel (BCP) to pemetrexed and cisplatin (PC) by using indirect comparison (ITC) methodology. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In the absence of head-to-head trials, ITC was performed on patients with adenocarcinoma histology non-squamous NSCLC to compare the relative benefit of first-line therapies BCP vs. PC by hazard ratios (HR). Subsequently, these HRs were used in a decision-analytic Markov model with a lifelong time horizon to extrapolate the long-term effectiveness of the two treatments. RESULTS: ITC estimated HRs for the primary endpoints in the bevacizumab study E4599 showed that BCP treatment in non-squamous adenocarcinoma NSCLC patients resulted in a BCP HR of 0.82 versus PC. The long-term predictions from the Markov model yielded a mean survival of 1.48 years (95% CI 1.34, 1.62 years) (or 17.7 months) for BCP compared with 1.29 years (95% CI 1.16, 1.42 years) (or 15.4 months) for PC. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our decision analysis, triplet BCP targeted therapy in patients with advanced non-squamous adenocarcinoma NSCLC compared with doublet PC chemotherapy results in improved expected values for overall long-term survival. Therefore, from the efficacy perspective, bevacizumab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy can be considered as the targeted therapy of choice for patients with advanced non-squamous adenocarcinoma NSCLC.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

METHODS: Patients with EGFR-positive lung adenocarcinoma who had received second-line PC with or without bevacizumab harboring EGFR non-T790M mutations after progression on first-line EGFR-TKIs between April 2015 and 2017 at Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital were enrolled in the study. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival and secondary endpoints were overall survival, objective response rate, disease control rate, and safety. RESULTS: A total of 85 patients were eligible for the study: 55 and 30 cases were enrolled in the PC and PC + B groups, respectively. The median progression-free survival was prolonged with PC + B compared to PC (median 8.2 vs. 5.1 months; P = 0.037). The objective response rate was improved with PC + B compared to PC (46.7% vs. 25.5%; P = 0.047) and overall survival prolonged with PC + B compared to PC (median 26.3 vs. 19.2 months; P = 0.012). Safety was similar to previous studies of bevacizumab in non-small cell lung cancer: one patient experienced grade 3 hypertension and proteinuria but did not require the discontinuation of therapy. CONCLUSION: The addition of bevacizumab to PC was superior to PC alone as second-line therapy in patients with advanced non-T90M EGFR-positive lung adenocarcinoma. However, this result needs to be confirmed by prospective clinical trials.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 35397125\nTitle: Efficacy, safety and prognostic factors of camrelizumab plus carboplatin and pemetrexed chemotherapy in advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients.\nAuthors: Lv J, Zhang W, Deng R\nJournal: Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics\nPublication Date: 2022 Aug\nAbstract: WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Camrelizumab is a recently developed PD-1 inhibitor in China applied in treating different cancers including lung cancer. This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and prognostic factors for camrelizumab plus carboplatin and pemetrexed (CP) chemotherapy in treating patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma. METHODS: Of 51 advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients with negative driver genes who received camrelizumab plus CP chemotherapy were recruited. These patients received four cycles of camrelizumab plus CP chemotherapy in a 21-day cycle. Then, camrelizumab, pemetrexed or camrelizumab plus pemetrexed was administered as maintenance therapy. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The rates of complete response, partial response, stable disease and progressive disease were 2.0%, 56.8%, 19.6% and 5.9%, respectively; while treatment response of 15.7% of patients was missing or not evaluable. The objective response and disease control rates were 58.8% and 78.4%, respectively. With a median follow-up period of 14.9 months (the follow-up duration ranged from 3.9 months to 24.3 months), 41 (83.4%) cases of disease progression and 22 (43.1%) cases of death were recorded. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 10.5 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 8.4-12.6 months) with a 1-year PFS rate of 36.3% and a 2-year PFS rate of 7.5%. In addition, the median overall survival (OS) was 18.7 months (95% CI: 16.4-21.0 months) with a 1-year OS rate of 79.1% and a 2-year OS rate of 30.4%. In consideration of safety, the most frequent adverse events were peripheral neuropathy (37.3%), neutropenia (37.3%), alopecia (35.3%), etc. and most of them were grade 1-2 and could be controlled. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Camrelizumab plus CP chemotherapy achieves favourable efficacy and tolerable adverse events in advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 34369074\nTitle: Carboplatin, pemetrexed, and pembrolizumab was effective for primary salivary gland-type lung adenocarcinoma diagnosed due to esophageal stricture: A case report.\nAuthors: Kawakado K, Tamura T, Nakanishi M\nJournal: Thoracic cancer\nPublication Date: 2021 Sep\nAbstract: Primary salivary gland-type tumors of the lung are rare, accounting for <1% of all lung tumors. There are few reports on chemotherapy for the treatment of primary salivary gland-type tumors of the lung. The patient in this report was a 71-year-old woman who presented with a chief complaint of dysphagia. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed an esophageal stricture, but biopsy showed no malignancy. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed carcinomatous lymphangiomatosis and a nodule in the right lung. Bronchoscopy showed a rough mucous membrane of the central bronchi, while biopsy showed adenocarcinoma. The patient was diagnosed with bronchogenic adenocarcinoma and received carboplatin, pemetrexed, and pembrolizumab, which alleviated the esophageal stricture and cancerous lymphangiopathy. However, the adenocarcinoma progressed, and she subsequently received several rounds of chemotherapy. One year after diagnosis, the patient died, and pathological autopsy revealed primary salivary gland-type tumors of the lung.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

METHODS: Retrospective analysis was carried out to compare the clinico-pathologic features and survival of 129 young patients (young group) with those of 140 randomly selected older ones (elderly group). RESULTS: The young group, when compared with the older group, had more female (P = 0.037), longer mean duration of symptoms (4.7 m vs 2.5 m, P < 0.001), higher misdiagnostic rate (65.1% vs 24.3%, P < 0.001) with longer mean duration of misdiagnosis for the misdiagnosed patients (5.6 m vs 2.5 m, P < 0.001), more adenocarcinoma (54.3% vs 42.1%, P < 0.001), higher pathologic grade (69.5% vs 36.0%, P < 0.001), more advanced-stage diseases at diagnosis (74.4% vs 45.7%, P < 0.001), more patients receiving combined-modality treatment (94.6% vs 62.1%, P < 0.001) and more distant failures as initial relapse (64.7% vs 50.6%, P = 0.02). The median survivals and 5-year survival rates were better in patients with stage I-II disease in the young group than the older group (54 m vs 33 m and 46.2% vs 25.0%, P = 0.0495), even though the overall median survivals and 5-year survival rates were similar in either group (11 m vs 14 m and 8.3% vs 11.9%, P = 0.2889). There was no difference in family or smoking history (P = 0.227 and 0.171). CONCLUSION: Younger patients with lung cancer present difference in clinico-pathologic features from the older ones, but the survivals of the two groups are similar.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 117 patients with lung adenocarcinoma and bone metastases who were followed up at a single institution for 0.2 months to 66 months. Of these 117 patients, 45 were EGFR mutation-positive and further analysis was performed for these patients. Median survival times and five-year survival rates were investigated according to performance status (PS), oligometastatic status, radiotherapy and EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) administration. RESULTS: The five-year survival rate of EGFR mutation-positive patients was 9.2%, and median survival time was 22.7 months; their mean age was 69.5 years. Many EGFR mutation-positive patients had a PS of 2, and the median survival time showed significant differences according to PS (0/1/2 vs. 3/4) and oligometastatic status. CONCLUSION: Although there was no difference in the mean survival time between patients receiving or not receiving bone radiotherapy, the treatment effectively reduced pain and prevented paralysis. As a first-line treatment in EGFR mutation-positive patients, first- or second-generation TKIs followed by third-generation TKIs showed favorable outcomes.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 33767989\nTitle: Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 Beta Expression Correlates With Worse Overall Survival in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer-A Clinicopathological Series.\nAuthors: Alves M, Borges DP, Kimberly A\nJournal: Frontiers in oncology\nPublication Date: 2021\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 beta (GSK-3beta) regulates diverse cell functions including metabolic activity, signaling and structural proteins. GSK-3beta phosphorylates target pro-oncogenes and regulates programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). This study investigated the correlation between GSK-3beta expression and clinically relevant molecular features of lung adenocarcinoma (PDL1 score, PTEN expression and driver mutations). METHODS: We evaluated 95 lung cancer specimens from biopsies and surgical resections. Immunohistochemistry was performed to analyze the expression of GSK-3beta, PTEN, and PDL1. Epidemiological data, molecular characteristics and staging were evaluated from medical records. The histologic classification was performed by an experienced pulmonary pathologist. RESULTS: Most patients were female (52.6%) and the majority had a positive smoking history. The median age was 68.3 years, with individuals over 60 years accounting for 82.1%. The predominant histological subtype was adenocarcinoma (69.5%), followed by squamous cell carcinoma (20.0%). GSK-3beta expression in tumors was cytoplasmic with a dotted pattern and perinuclear concentration, with associated membranous staining. Seven (7.3%) tumors had associated nuclear expression localization. Seventy-seven patients (81.1%) had advanced clinical-stage tumors. GSK-3beta was positive in 75 tumors (78%) and GSK3-positive tumors tended to be diagnosed at advanced stages. Among stage III/IV tumors, 84% showed GSK3 positivity (p= 0.007). We identified a statistically significant association between GSK-3beta and PTEN in the qualitative analysis (p 0.021); and when comparing PTEN to GSK-3beta intensity 2+ (p 0.001) or 3+ expression (> 50%) - p 0.013. GSK-3beta positive tumors with a high histological score had a worse overall survival. CONCLUSION: We identified the histological patterns of GSK-3beta expression and evaluated its potential as marker for overall survival, establishing a simple histological score to measure the evaluated status in resected tissues. The use of GSK-3beta expression as an immune response biomarker remains a challenge. Future studies will seek to explain the role of its interaction with PTEN.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
