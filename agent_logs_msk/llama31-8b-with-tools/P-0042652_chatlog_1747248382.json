Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nCapecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers. Capecitabine is a prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to fluorouracil (antimetabolite) in the tumor, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor tissue.\nTrametinib: Trametinib is an orally bioavailable mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2 inhibitor.[A258298,A258293] It was first approved by the FDA in May 2013 for the treatment of melanoma.[A258298] It was later approved by Health Canada on July 18, 2013 [L45588] and by the European Commission on June 30, 2014.[L45583] Trametinib is currently approved to treat a variety of cancers with BRAF mutations, such as non-small cell lung cancer and thyroid cancer, as monotherapy or in combination with [dabrafenib], a BRAF inhibitor, for improved therapeutic efficacy. Originally developed by Japan Tobacco, trametinib was initially investigated for treating inflammation, but further studies for this indication were not pursued.[A258298]\nDabrafenib: Dabrafenib mesylate (Tafinlar) is a reversible ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor and targets the MAPK pathway. It was approved on May 29, 2013, for the treatment of melanoma with V600E or V6000K mutation.[L41955] It was also used for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with the same mutation.[L41955]\r\n\r\nIn May 2018, Tafinlar (dabrafenib), in combination with Mekinist ([DB08911]), was approved to treat anaplastic thyroid cancer caused by an abnormal BRAF V600E gene.[L41955]\nNivolumab: Nivolumab is a fully human IgG4 antibody targeting the immune checkpoint programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1).[L12129] This antibody was produced entirely in mice and grafted onto human kappa and IgG4 Fc region with the mutation _S228P_ for additional stability and reduced variability.[A35203] It was developed by Bristol Myers Squibb.[L12129]\r\n\r\nNivolumab was granted FDA approval on 22 December 2014.[L12129] It is also available in combination with [relatlimab] under the brand name Opdualag.[L41265,L49996,L50001]\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

Complete nodal response is not universal in these patients and is difficult to assess clinically. Quantifying the risk of nodal disease would allow for targeted therapy with either radical resection or \"watchful waiting.\" OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify risk factors for residual nodal disease in ypT0 rectal adenocarcinoma. DESIGN: This is a retrospective case control study. SETTINGS: The National Cancer Database 2006 to 2014 was used to identify patients for this study. PATIENTS: Patients with stage II/III rectal adenocarcinoma who completed chemoradiation therapy followed by resection and who had ypT0 tumors were included. Patients with metastatic disease and <2 lymph nodes evaluated were excluded. Patients were divided into 2 groups: node positive and node negative. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome was nodal disease. The secondary outcome was overall survival. RESULTS: A total of 42,257 patients with stage II/III rectal cancer underwent chemoradiation therapy and radical resection; 4170 (9.9%) patients had ypT0 tumors and 395 (9.5%) were node positive. Of patients with clinically node-negative disease (ie, pretreatment imaging), 6.2% were node positive after chemoradiation therapy and resection. In multivariable analysis, factors predictive of nodal disease included increasing (pretreatment) clinical N-stage, high tumor grade (3/4), perineural invasion, and lymphovascular invasion. Higher clinical T-stage was inversely associated with residual nodal disease. Overall 5-year survival was significantly different between patients with ypN0, ypN1, and ypN2 disease (87.4%, 82.2%, and 62.5%, p = 0.002). LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by the lack of clinical detail in the database and the inability to assess recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Ten percent of patients with ypT0 tumors had positive nodes after chemoradiation therapy and resection. Factors associated with residual nodal disease included clinical nodal disease at diagnosis and poor histologic features. Patients with any of these features should consider radical resection regardless of tumor response. Others could be suitable for \"watchful waiting\" strategies.

A Population-Based, Retrospective Cohort Study.\nAuthors: Swartjes H, van Lankveld DWP, van Erning FN\nJournal: Annals of surgical oncology\nPublication Date: 2023 Mar\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: The reported outcomes of locoregionally recurrent colon cancer (LRCC) are poor, but the literature about LRCC is scarce and aged. Recent population-based studies to provide current insight into LRCC are warranted. This study aimed to provide an overview of the incidence, risk factors, treatment, and overall survival (OS) of patients with LRCC after curative resection of stage I-III primary colon cancer. METHODS: Data on disease recurrence were collected for all patients with a diagnosis of non-metastasized primary colon cancer in the Netherlands during the first 6 months of 2015. Patients who underwent surgical resection (N = 3544) were included in this study. The 3-year cumulative incidence, risk factors, treatment, and OS for patients with LRCC were determined. RESULTS: The 3-year cumulative incidence of LRCC was 3.8%. Synchronous distant metastases (LRCC-M1) were diagnosed in 62.7% of the patients. The risk factors for LRCC were age of 70 years or older, pT4, pN1-2, and R1-2. Adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with a decreased risk of LRCC for high-risk stage II and stage III patients [hazard ratio (HR), 0.47; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31-0.93]. The median OS for the patients with LRCC was 13.1 months (95% CI 9.1-18.3 months). Curative-intent treatment was given to 22.4% of the LRCC patients, and the subsequent 3 years OS was 71% (95% CI 58-87%). The patients treated with palliative treatment and best supportive care showed 3-year OS rates of 15% (95% CI 7.0-31%) and 3.7% (95% CI 1.0-14%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The cumulative incidence of LRCC was low, and adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with a decreased risk for LRCC among targeted patients. Curative-intent treatment was given to nearly 1 in 4 LRCC patients, and the OS for this group was high.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 25918287\nTitle: Personalizing colon cancer adjuvant therapy: selecting optimal treatments for individual patients.\nAuthors: Dienstmann R, Salazar R, Tabernero J\nJournal: Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology\nPublication Date: 2015 Jun 1\nAbstract: For more than three decades, postoperative chemotherapy-initially fluoropyrimidines and more recently combinations with oxaliplatin-has reduced the risk of tumor recurrence and improved survival for patients with resected colon cancer. Although universally recommended for patients with stage III disease, there is no consensus about the survival benefit of postoperative chemotherapy in stage II colon cancer. The most recent adjuvant clinical trials have not shown any value for adding targeted agents, namely bevacizumab and cetuximab, to standard chemotherapies in stage III disease, despite improved outcomes in the metastatic setting. However, biomarker analyses of multiple studies strongly support the feasibility of refining risk stratification in colon cancer by factoring in molecular characteristics with pathologic tumor staging. In stage II disease, for example, microsatellite instability supports observation after surgery. Furthermore, the value of BRAF or KRAS mutations as additional risk factors in stage III disease is greater when microsatellite status and tumor location are taken into account. Validated predictive markers of adjuvant chemotherapy benefit for stage II or III colon cancer are lacking, but intensive research is ongoing. Recent advances in understanding the biologic hallmarks and drivers of early-stage disease as well as the micrometastatic environment are expected to translate into therapeutic strategies tailored to select patients. This review focuses on the pathologic, molecular, and gene expression characterizations of early-stage colon cancer; new insights into prognostication; and emerging predictive biomarkers that could ultimately help define the optimal adjuvant treatments for patients in routine clinical practice.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

The patient's most recent CEA level is 1.1000 ng/ml, which is within the normal range.\n\nBased on the information provided, I would say that the patient's risk of cancer recurrence in the next 12 months is low, but not zero. The patient's age, tumor characteristics, and treatment history suggest that they may be at a lower risk of recurrence, but it is still possible that the cancer could recur.\n\nTherefore, I would recommend that the patient continue to follow up with their oncologist and undergo regular monitoring, including CEA levels and imaging studies, to detect any potential recurrence early.\n\n[ANSWER: B)"

Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nCapecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers. Capecitabine is a prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to fluorouracil (antimetabolite) in the tumor, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor tissue.\nTrametinib: Trametinib is an orally bioavailable mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2 inhibitor.[A258298,A258293] It was first approved by the FDA in May 2013 for the treatment of melanoma.[A258298] It was later approved by Health Canada on July 18, 2013 [L45588] and by the European Commission on June 30, 2014.[L45583] Trametinib is currently approved to treat a variety of cancers with BRAF mutations, such as non-small cell lung cancer and thyroid cancer, as monotherapy or in combination with [dabrafenib], a BRAF inhibitor, for improved therapeutic efficacy. Originally developed by Japan Tobacco, trametinib was initially investigated for treating inflammation, but further studies for this indication were not pursued.[A258298]\nDabrafenib: Dabrafenib mesylate (Tafinlar) is a reversible ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor and targets the MAPK pathway. It was approved on May 29, 2013, for the treatment of melanoma with V600E or V6000K mutation.[L41955] It was also used for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with the same mutation.[L41955]\r\n\r\nIn May 2018, Tafinlar (dabrafenib), in combination with Mekinist ([DB08911]), was approved to treat anaplastic thyroid cancer caused by an abnormal BRAF V600E gene.[L41955]\nNivolumab: Nivolumab is a fully human IgG4 antibody targeting the immune checkpoint programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1).[L12129] This antibody was produced entirely in mice and grafted onto human kappa and IgG4 Fc region with the mutation _S228P_ for additional stability and reduced variability.[A35203] It was developed by Bristol Myers Squibb.[L12129]\r\n\r\nNivolumab was granted FDA approval on 22 December 2014.[L12129] It is also available in combination with [relatlimab] under the brand name Opdualag.[L41265,L49996,L50001]\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

cancers with BRAF mutations, such as non-small cell lung cancer and thyroid cancer, as monotherapy or in combination with [dabrafenib], a BRAF inhibitor, for improved therapeutic efficacy. Originally developed by Japan Tobacco, trametinib was initially investigated for treating inflammation, but further studies for this indication were not pursued.[A258298]\nDabrafenib: Dabrafenib mesylate (Tafinlar) is a reversible ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor and targets the MAPK pathway. It was approved on May 29, 2013, for the treatment of melanoma with V600E or V6000K mutation.[L41955] It was also used for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with the same mutation.[L41955]\r\n\r\nIn May 2018, Tafinlar (dabrafenib), in combination with Mekinist ([DB08911]), was approved to treat anaplastic thyroid cancer caused by an abnormal BRAF V600E gene.[L41955]\nNivolumab: Nivolumab is a fully human IgG4 antibody targeting the immune checkpoint programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1).[L12129] This antibody was produced entirely in mice and grafted onto human kappa and IgG4 Fc region with the mutation _S228P_ for additional stability and reduced variability.[A35203] It was developed by Bristol Myers Squibb.[L12129]\r\n\r\nNivolumab was granted FDA approval on 22 December 2014.[L12129] It is also available in combination with [relatlimab] under the brand name Opdualag.[L41265,L49996,L50001]\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in

Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nCapecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers. Capecitabine is a prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to fluorouracil (antimetabolite) in the tumor, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor tissue.\nTrametinib: Trametinib is an orally bioavailable mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2 inhibitor.[A258298,A258293] It was first approved by the FDA in May 2013 for the treatment of melanoma.[A258298] It was later approved by Health Canada on July 18, 2013 [L45588] and by the European Commission on June 30, 2014.[L45583] Trametinib is currently approved to treat a variety of cancers with BRAF mutations, such as non-small cell lung cancer and thyroid cancer, as monotherapy or in combination with [dabrafenib], a BRAF inhibitor, for improved therapeutic efficacy.

The patient has undergone various treatments, including chemotherapy and targeted therapy, but the cancer has continued to progress.\n\nThe patient's most recent CEA level is 1.8000 ng/ml, which is elevated, suggesting that the cancer is actively progressing.\n\nAdditionally, the patient's age and overall health status suggest that they may not be a good candidate for further aggressive treatment.\n\nTherefore, I would recommend that the patient's family and healthcare team consider palliative care options to improve the patient's quality of life.\n\n[ANSWER: B]"
