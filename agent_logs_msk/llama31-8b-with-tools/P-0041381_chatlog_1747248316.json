PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective data were collected from patients (n=203) with UICC stage II and III rectal adenocarcinomas, who underwent low anterior or abdominoperineal resection and received post-operative or pre-operative radiochemotherapy from January 1989 until July 2002. The rates of survival and distant and local recurrences were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Log-rank test and Cox's proportional hazards (median follow-up 8 years). Multivariate analysis was used to assess the prognostic value of CEA and CA 19-9. RESULTS: The 5-year actuarial rates for patients with normal (n =118) and elevated (n=88) CEA values were as follows: overall survival 62.4% and 32.0% (p<0.001), local control 73.5% and 55.0% (p=0.007), and absence of distant metastasis 83.3% and 88.0% (n.s.), respectively. Similar results were obtained for patients with normal (n=82) and elevated (n = 10) CA 19-9 values: overall survival 60.7% and 14.0% (p=0.007), local control 83.7% and 80.0% (n.s.), and absence of distant metastasis 64.9% and 75.0% (n.s.), respectively. After adjustment for TNM stage, sex, age, LDH, tumor site and grading, the elevation of CEA proved to be an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (relative risk of 1.01 per ng/ml, CI 1.002 - 1.01; p=0.005). CONCLUSION: This study confirmed the prognostic value of pre-radiotherapy CEA and CA 19-9 in patients with stage II or III rectal carcinoma.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 26047368\nTitle: Correlation of CEA but not CA 19-9 as serum biomarkers of disease activity in a case of metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Marks EI, Brennan M, El-Deiry WS\nJournal: Cancer biology & therapy\nPublication Date: 2015\nAbstract: We present the case of a 62-year-old-man with moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the rectum. This patient underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation and surgical resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. After completing therapy, this patient had 2 instances of CEA elevation, both of which preceded the discovery of recurrent disease. While on treatment for these recurrences, CA 19-9 increased rapidly to 4,405. This CA 19-9 elevation persisted for approximately 4 months in the absence of clinical, radiographic or additional serologic evidence of progressive disease before returning to baseline. Shortly after this tumor marker normalized, a small area of locally recurrent disease was discovered. This case highlights the utility and pitfalls of colorectal cancer disease monitoring with CEA and CA 19-9. The differential diagnosis of CA 19-9 elevation is discussed in this report.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 35748234\nTitle: [Two Cases of Robot-Assisted Total Pelvic Exenteration and Intracorporeal Ileal Conduit for Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer].\nAuthors: Sasaki Y, Atagi M, Tada K\nJournal: Hinyokika kiyo. Acta urologica Japonica\nPublication Date: 2022 May\nAbstract: We describe two cases of locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) treated with robot-assisted total pelvic exenteration (Ra-TPE) and intracorporeal ileal conduit (ICIC). The first case was in a 71-year-old man with LARC (RbP, T4bN2bM0, cStage IIIc). He was started on bevacizumab+S-1/oxaliplatin therapy in July 2019. In April 2020, he developed Fournier's gangrene due to subcutaneous penetration of rectal cancer. Emergency drainage and colostomy were performed simultaneously, and a percutaneous vesical fistula was created. In May 2020, Ra-TPE and ICIC were performed. Histopathological analysis revealed moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma (ypT3N0, RM0). At postoperative 9 months, thoracoscopic right upper lobectomy was performed for a right metastatic lung tumor. At present, ie, at postoperative 12 months, the patient has been free of recurrence and metastasis, with a carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level of 1.4 ng/ml and carcinoma antigen (CA) 19-9 level of 11 U/ml. The second case was in a 61-year-old man with fistula-associated anal cancer (PRb, T4N3M1b, cStage IVb). In April 2019, he was started on FOLFOXIRI+cetuximab therapy. In August 2020, Ra-TPE, ICIC, and transperineal total mesenteric excision were performed. Histopathological analysis revealed adenocarcinoma (ypT4N0, RM0). At postoperative 11 months, thoracoscopic left lower lobectomy was performed for a left metastatic lung tumor. At present, ie, at postoperative 12 months, the patient remains free of recurrence and metastasis, with a CEA level of 7.3 ng/ml and CA19-9 level of 12 U/ml. Ra-TPE, which allows transperineal removal of a specimen, can be performed as a minimally invasive surgery in combination with ICIC.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

It was originally investigated for its antiviral effects, but it is now used as an anticancer therapy for various cancers.[A233135] Gemcitabine is a cytidine analog with two fluorine atoms replacing the hydroxyl on the ribose.[A233145] As a prodrug, gemcitabine is transformed into its active metabolites that work by replacing the building blocks of nucleic acids during DNA elongation, arresting tumour growth and promoting apoptosis of malignant cells.[L32960] The structure, metabolism, and mechanism of action of gemcitabine are similar to [cytarabine], but gemcitabine has a wider spectrum of antitumour activity.[A233140]\r\n\r\nGemcitabine is marketed as Gemzar and it is available as intravenous injection. It is approved by the FDA to treat advanced ovarian cancer in combination with [carboplatin], metastatic breast cancer in combination with [paclitaxel], non-small cell lung cancer in combination with [cisplatin], and pancreatic cancer as monotherapy.[L32950] It is also being investigated in other cancer and tumour types.\nCisplatin: Cisplatin, cisplatinum or cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (CDDP) is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug used to treat various types of cancers, including sarcomas, some carcinomas (e.g. small cell lung cancer, and ovarian cancer), lymphomas and germ cell tumors. It was the first member of its class, which now also includes carboplatin and oxaliplatin.\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: timeline1.txt] included in your context\nAGE: 52.166, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: Indeterminate, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: Indeterminate, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 52.166, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 52.366, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, HAS_CANCER: Yes, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, PELVIS: No, OTHER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 52.366, diagnosis > progression --> PROGRESSION: Indeterminate, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, \nAGE: 52.366, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), MR, TUMOR_SITE: Other, PELVIS: No, OTHER: Yes, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 52.900, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, HAS_CANCER: Yes, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, PELVIS: No, OTHER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 52.900, diagnosis > progression --> PROGRESSION: Y, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, \nAGE: 52.900, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), MR, TUMOR_SITE: Other, PELVIS: No, OTHER: Yes, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 52.922, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 52.922, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 53.470, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: Yes, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: No, OTHER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 53.470, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has progressed.\nAGE: 53.470, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), CT, TUMOR_SITE: Other, PELVIS: No, OTHER: Yes, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 53.470, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), CT, TUMOR_SITE: Lymph Nodes, PELVIS: No, OTHER: Yes, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 53.481, surgery --> SUBTYPE: PROCEDURE, \nAGE: 53.590, surgery --> SUBTYPE: PROCEDURE, \nAGE: 53.648, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: Yes, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: No, OTHER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 53.648, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 53.648, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), CT, TUMOR_SITE: Other, PELVIS: No, OTHER: Yes, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 53.648, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), CT, TUMOR_SITE: Lymph Nodes, PELVIS: No, OTHER: Yes, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 53.763, samples > clinical_sample --> SAMPLE_ID: P-0041381-T01-IM6, PATIENT_ID: P-0041381, CANCER_TYPE: Colorectal Cancer, SAMPLE_TYPE: Primary, SAMPLE_CLASS: Tumor, METASTATIC_SITE: Not Applicable, PRIMARY_SITE: Rectum, CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED: Rectal Adenocarcinoma, GENE_PANEL: IMPACT468, SAMPLE_COVERAGE: 368, TUMOR_PURITY: 30.0, ONCOTREE_CODE: READ, MSI_COMMENT: MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

chemotherapeutic agent. It was originally investigated for its antiviral effects, but it is now used as an anticancer therapy for various cancers.[A233135] Gemcitabine is a cytidine analog with two fluorine atoms replacing the hydroxyl on the ribose.[A233145] As a prodrug, gemcitabine is transformed into its active metabolites that work by replacing the building blocks of nucleic acids during DNA elongation, arresting tumour growth and promoting apoptosis of malignant cells.[L32960] The structure, metabolism, and mechanism of action of gemcitabine are similar to [cytarabine], but gemcitabine has a wider spectrum of antitumour activity.[A233140]\r\n\r\nGemcitabine is marketed as Gemzar and it is available as intravenous injection. It is approved by the FDA to treat advanced ovarian cancer in combination with [carboplatin], metastatic breast cancer in combination with [paclitaxel], non-small cell lung cancer in combination with [cisplatin], and pancreatic cancer as monotherapy.[L32950] It is also being investigated in other cancer and tumour types.\nCisplatin: Cisplatin, cisplatinum or cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (CDDP) is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug used to treat various types of cancers, including sarcomas, some carcinomas (e.g. small cell lung cancer, and ovarian cancer), lymphomas and germ cell tumors. It was the first member of its class, which now also includes carboplatin and oxaliplatin.\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: timeline1.txt] included in your context\nAGE: 52.166, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: Indeterminate, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: Indeterminate, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 52.166, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 52.366, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, HAS_CANCER: Yes, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, PELVIS: No, OTHER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 52.366, diagnosis > progression --> PROGRESSION: Indeterminate, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, \nAGE: 52.366, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), MR, TUMOR_SITE: Other, PELVIS: No, OTHER: Yes, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 52.900, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, HAS_CANCER: Yes, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, PELVIS: No, OTHER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 52.900, diagnosis > progression --> PROGRESSION: Y, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, \nAGE: 52.900, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), MR, TUMOR_SITE: Other, PELVIS: No, OTHER: Yes, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 52.922, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: No, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: Yes, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: Yes, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 52.922, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 53.470, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: Yes, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: No, OTHER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 53.470, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has progressed.\nAGE: 53.470, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), CT, TUMOR_SITE: Other, PELVIS: No, OTHER: Yes, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 53.470, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), CT, TUMOR_SITE: Lymph Nodes, PELVIS: No, OTHER: Yes, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 53.481, surgery --> SUBTYPE: PROCEDURE, \nAGE: 53.590, surgery --> SUBTYPE: PROCEDURE, \nAGE: 53.648, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: Yes, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: No, OTHER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 53.648, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 53.648, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), CT, TUMOR_SITE: Other, PELVIS: No, OTHER: Yes, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 53.648, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), CT, TUMOR_SITE: Lymph Nodes, PELVIS: No, OTHER: Yes, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 53.763, samples > clinical_sample --> SAMPLE_ID: P-0041381-T01-IM6, PATIENT_ID: P-0041381, CANCER_TYPE: Colorectal Cancer, SAMPLE_TYPE: Primary, SAMPLE_CLASS: Tumor, METASTATIC_SITE: Not Applicable, PRIMARY_SITE: Rectum, CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED: Rectal Adenocarcinoma, GENE_PANEL: IMPACT468, SAMPLE_COVERAGE: 368, TUMOR_PURITY: 30.0, ONCOTREE_CODE: READ, MSI_COMMENT: MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

It was originally investigated for its antiviral effects, but it is now used as an anticancer therapy for various cancers.[A233135] Gemcitabine is a cytidine analog with two fluorine atoms replacing the hydroxyl on the ribose.[A233145] As a prodrug, gemcitabine is transformed into its active metabolites that work by replacing the building blocks of nucleic acids during DNA elongation, arresting tumour growth and promoting apoptosis of malignant cells.[L32960] The structure, metabolism, and mechanism of action of gemcitabine are similar to [cytarabine], but gemcitabine has a wider spectrum of antitumour activity.[A233140]\r\n\r\nGemcitabine is marketed as Gemzar and it is available as intravenous injection. It is approved by the FDA to treat advanced ovarian cancer in combination with [carboplatin], metastatic breast cancer in combination with [paclitaxel], non-small cell lung cancer in combination with [cisplatin], and pancreatic cancer as monotherapy.[L32950] It is also being investigated in other cancer and tumour types.\nCisplatin: Cisplatin, cisplatinum or cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (CDDP) is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug used to treat various types of cancers, including sarcomas, some carcinomas (e.g. small cell lung cancer, and ovarian cancer), lymphomas and germ cell tumors. It was the first member of its class, which now also includes carboplatin and oxaliplatin.\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0041381-T01-IM6\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0041381\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Colorectal Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Rectum\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Rectal Adenocarcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT468\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 368, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 30.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"READ\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

It was originally investigated for its antiviral effects, but it is now used as an anticancer therapy for various cancers.[A233135] Gemcitabine is a cytidine analog with two fluorine atoms replacing the hydroxyl on the ribose.[A233145] As a prodrug, gemcitabine is transformed into its active metabolites that work by replacing the building blocks of nucleic acids during DNA elongation, arresting tumour growth and promoting apoptosis of malignant cells.[L32960] The structure, metabolism, and mechanism of action of gemcitabine are similar to [cytarabine], but gemcitabine has a wider spectrum of antitumour activity.[A233140]\r\n\r\nGemcitabine is marketed as Gemzar and it is available as intravenous injection. It is approved by the FDA to treat advanced ovarian cancer in combination with [carboplatin], metastatic breast cancer in combination with [paclitaxel], non-small cell lung cancer in combination with [cisplatin], and pancreatic cancer as monotherapy.[L32950] It is also being investigated in other cancer and tumour types.\nCisplatin: Cisplatin, cisplatinum or cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (CDDP) is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug used to treat various types of cancers, including sarcomas, some carcinomas (e.g. small cell lung cancer, and ovarian cancer), lymphomas and germ cell tumors. It was the first member of its class, which now also includes carboplatin and oxaliplatin.\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0041381-T01-IM6\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0041381\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Colorectal Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Rectum\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Rectal Adenocarcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT468\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 368, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 30.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"READ\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).
