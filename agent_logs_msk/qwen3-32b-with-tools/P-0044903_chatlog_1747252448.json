Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

The question is whether the cancer will recur in the next 24 months. The answer options are Yes or No.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the provided files: specimen.txt and timeline0.txt. From specimen.txt, I see that the cancer type is Rectal Adenocarcinoma, stage 1-3 (Stage_CDM_Derived), and the pathological group is 3A. The MSI status is microsatellite stable (MSS), which generally has a different prognosis compared to microsatellite instability (MSI). MSS is often associated with a higher risk of recurrence in some cancers, but I need to verify that.\n\nLooking at the timeline.txt, the patient underwent surgery and chemotherapy (FOLFOX regimen: Oxaliplatin, Fluorouracil, Leucovorin) from age 66.310 to 66.504. Follow-up scans (CT and MR) up to age 67.282 (which is about 1.3 years post-treatment) show no progression. CEA levels fluctuated but remained within normal ranges (normal is usually <5 ng/ml). The last CEA at 67.014 was 4.3, which is normal. \n\nThe stage is Stage 1-3, but more specifically, the pathological group 3A might indicate Stage III, which typically has a higher risk of recurrence. However, the treatment included adjuvant chemotherapy, which is standard for Stage III to reduce recurrence risk. The fact that follow-up scans up to 1.3 years post-treatment show no recurrence is a good sign. \n\nMSI status is MSS, which in colorectal cancer is associated with a higher likelihood of recurrence compared to MSI-H. However, the patient received adjuvant chemo, which might mitigate some of that risk. The TMB (tumor mutational burden) is low (3.45), which might suggest lower neoantigen production and potentially less response to immunotherapy, but since the patient is on chemo, that's less relevant here.\n\nThe question is about recurrence in the next 24 months. The follow-up data only goes up to about 1.3 years post-treatment (age 67.282). So, there's a gap beyond that point. Without data beyond 1.3 years, it's hard to predict with certainty. However, the absence of recurrence in the first 1.3 years and the treatment received might suggest a lower risk, but Stage III cancers generally have a 30-40% risk of recurrence within 5 years. The answer might depend on factors like the specific stage (III A, B, C), response to chemo, and other biomarkers. \n\nSince the provided data doesn't include information beyond 1.3 years and the current follow-up is negative, but the inherent risk for Stage III is significant, the answer might be uncertain. However, the options are Yes or No. Given the data up to 1.3 years and the treatment, maybe the answer leans towards No, but I need to check if there's any other info. \n\nWait, the patient's age is 67.3 now, so the timeline up to 67.282 is almost 1.3 years post-treatment. The question is about the next 24 months from age 67.3. So, the follow-up period covered is up to 1.3 years post-treatment, and the next 24 months would take it to about 3.7 years post-treatment. Without data beyond that, it's hard to say. However, based on standard recurrence rates and the treatment, maybe the answer is No, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, given the Stage III and MSS, the risk is higher, so maybe Yes. But the follow-up is negative so far. \n\nI need to check PUBMED for recurrence rates in Stage III rectal cancer with adjuvant chemo.

Trials have benn generally restricted to patients with stage II and III rectal cancer. The purpose of the present study is to determine the efficacy of a preoperative combination of radiation therapy and chemotherapy in operable locally advanced rectal cancer. METHODS: From March 1990 to June 1994, 58 patients with histologically documented adenocarcinoma of the rectum entered our protocol. 35 neoplasms were located in the lower third of the rectum and the remaining 23 in the middle third. At pre-treatment clinical staging 46 tumors were judged as stage III and 12 as stage II. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy were started jointly on day one of the treatment. Mitomycin-C was given as a bolus intravenous at a dosage of 10 mg/m2, the first day. 5-Fluorouracil was given in a dosage of 1000 mg./m2/day as a continuous 24 h infusion for 4 days. Radiation therapy was given at a total dosage of 37.8 Gy. Surgery was generally performed four to five weeks following completion of the radiation therapy. RESULTS: Patients compliance to the treatment was 96 percent. A reduction of tumor size > 50 percent was observed in 65 percent of patients. Tumor distance from anal canal increased in 75 percent of patients. Morbidity rate was 31 percent; no postoperative mortality was reported. Histological examination of surgical specimens showed that in 54 percent of patients tumor disappeared or was confined to the rectum; there was no evidence of tumor cells in 5 cases and stage I lesions were diagnosed in 19 cases (35 percent). Preliminary data on recurrences show a 5 percent local recurrence rate and a 7 percent distant metastases rate. CONCLUSIONS: It may be concluded that preoperative radiochemotherapy is generally well tolerated; surgery does not present additional technical difficulties; the effect of stage reduction has been observed in a consistent number of cases.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 25480874\nTitle: Adjuvant chemotherapy for rectal cancer patients treated with preoperative (chemo)radiotherapy and total mesorectal excision: a Dutch Colorectal Cancer Group (DCCG) randomized phase III trial.\nAuthors: Breugom AJ, van Gijn W, Muller EW\nJournal: Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology\nPublication Date: 2015 Apr\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: The discussion on the role of adjuvant chemotherapy for rectal cancer patients treated according to current guidelines is still ongoing. A multicentre, randomized phase III trial, PROCTOR-SCRIPT, was conducted to compare adjuvant chemotherapy with observation for rectal cancer patients treated with preoperative (chemo)radiotherapy and total mesorectal excision (TME). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The PROCTOR-SCRIPT trial recruited patients from 52 hospitals. Patients with histologically proven stage II or III rectal adenocarcinoma were randomly assigned (1:1) to observation or adjuvant chemotherapy after preoperative (chemo)radiotherapy and TME. Radiotherapy consisted of 5 x 5 Gy. Chemoradiotherapy consisted of 25 x 1.8-2 Gy combined with 5-FU-based chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy consisted of 5-FU/LV (PROCTOR) or eight courses capecitabine (SCRIPT). Randomization was based on permuted blocks of six, stratified according to centre, residual tumour, time between last irradiation and surgery, and preoperative treatment. The primary end point was overall survival. RESULTS: Of 470 enrolled patients, 437 were eligible. The trial closed prematurely because of slow patient accrual. Patients were randomly assigned to observation (n = 221) or adjuvant chemotherapy (n = 216). After a median follow-up of 5.0 years, 5-year overall survival was 79.2% in the observation group and 80.4% in the chemotherapy group [hazard ratio (HR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62-1.39; P = 0.73]. The HR for disease-free survival was 0.80 (95% CI 0.60-1.07; P = 0.13). Five-year cumulative incidence for locoregional recurrences was 7.8% in both groups. Five-year cumulative incidence for distant recurrences was 38.5% and 34.7%, respectively (P = 0.39). CONCLUSION: The PROCTOR-SCRIPT trial could not demonstrate a significant benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy with fluoropyrimidine monotherapy after preoperative (chemo)radiotherapy and TME on overall survival, disease-free survival, and recurrence rate. However, this trial did not complete planned accrual.

We wanted to examine whether the number of chemotherapy cycles and the relative dose intensity (RDI) of capecitabine monotherapy in the adjuvant setting are affecting disease recurrence. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included patients with completely resected stage II and III colon and upper rectum cancer who received adjuvant capecitabine monotherapy, from 2003 until May 2020. Patients with early relapse, i.e. during chemotherapy or within 6 months after the completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, and those with rectal cancer who received radiotherapy were excluded. Patients were divided into 3 groups based on the number of chemotherapy cycles received and the RDI. Group A included patients with </=4 cycles of chemotherapy, group B patients with >4 cycles of chemotherapy and RDI </=80%, and group C patients with >4 cycles of chemotherapy and RDI >80%. Study's endpoint, was recurrence free survival (RFS). RESULTS: Two hundred twenty six patients with stage II and III disease (164 and 62 respectively) were included. Sixteen, 166 and 44 were included in groups A, B and C respectively. After a median follow-up of 41 months, 21 patients (9,3%) had relapsed. Patients belonging to group C were found to have a trend for lower relapse rate compared to patients belonging to group A or group B. CONCLUSION: Number of adjuvant capecitabine cycles and RDI might play a role in RFS in patients with stage II and III colon and upper rectum adenocarcinoma.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

The options are Yes or No.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the provided patient data. From the specimen.txt and timeline0.txt files, the patient was diagnosed with stage III rectal adenocarcinoma (Stage 1-3 derived as per STAGE_CDM_DERIVED). The treatment included FOLFOX regimen (Oxaliplatin, Fluorouracil, Leucovorin) as part of adjuvant chemotherapy. The patient's cancer was microsatellite stable (MSS), which is important because MSS tumors typically have different prognostic factors compared to microsatellite instability (MSI) tumors. \n\nThe timeline shows that after treatment, follow-up imaging (CT scans and MRIs) up to age 67.282 (which is about 1.2 years post-diagnosis) indicated no progression. CEA levels were within normal ranges (4.3 ng/ml at 67.014, which is still under 5). The patient's performance status (ECOG) was 0 or 1, indicating good overall health.\n\nNow, looking at the PubMed results. The PROCTOR-SCRIPT trial (PMID 25480874) compared adjuvant chemotherapy with observation in stage II/III rectal cancer patients who had preoperative chemoradiotherapy. The 5-year overall survival was 79.2% in the observation group and 80.4% in the chemotherapy group, with no significant difference. However, the trial didn't complete its planned accrual, so the results might not be definitive. Another study (PMID 36967268) suggested that higher relative dose intensity (RDI) and more cycles of capecitabine might improve recurrence-free survival, but this was in colon and upper rectum cancers, and the patient here received FOLFOX, not capecitabine.\n\nThe patient's treatment included adjuvant chemotherapy (FOLFOX), which is standard for stage III rectal cancer. The follow-up period mentioned is up to about 1.2 years post-diagnosis, and no recurrence was detected. The median follow-up in the PROCTOR-SCRIPT trial was 5 years, but the patient's follow-up is shorter. However, given the lack of recurrence in the first year and a half, and the use of standard adjuvant therapy, the risk of recurrence within the next 24 months (which would be up to about 2 years post-diagnosis) might be lower. \n\nAdditionally, the patient's CEA levels remained normal, which is a good prognostic sign. MSS tumors generally have a better prognosis than MSI in some contexts, though in colorectal cancer, MSI is often associated with better outcomes, but since this is MSS, it might not have that protective effect. However, the adjuvant chemotherapy might have mitigated the risk.\n\nConsidering the PROCTOR-SCRIPT trial's 5-year local recurrence rate was 7.8% in both groups, but the patient's follow-up is only 1.2 years. The 2-year recurrence rate might be lower than the 5-year rate. Also, the patient's treatment included chemotherapy, which in some studies hasn't shown a significant benefit but might still contribute to reduced recurrence risk.\n\nPutting this all together, the patient has received standard adjuvant therapy, has normal CEA levels, and no signs of recurrence in the first year and a half. While the 5-year recurrence rates from trials are around 38-34% for distant recurrences, the 24-month mark might be lower. Given the lack of evidence of recurrence in the follow-up data provided and the treatment received, the answer leans towards No recurrence in the next 24 months.\n</think>\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"

        "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 67.3-year-old male with rectal adenocarcinoma. The question is whether the cancer will progress in the next 24 months. The options are Yes or No.\n\nFirst, I need to review the provided files. The specimen.txt mentions the cancer is stage 1-3, with a pathological group 3A. The timeline0.txt shows that at age 66.08, a CT scan indicated no progression. Later, at 66.425 and 67.014, other CT scans also showed no progression. The patient underwent chemotherapy with FOLFOX regimen (Oxaliplatin, Fluorouracil, Leucovorin) from age 66.310 to 66.504. \n\nLooking at the PubMed results, the PROCTOR-SCRIPT trial (PMID 25480874) found no significant difference in recurrence rates between those who had adjuvant chemotherapy and those who didn't, though the trial didn't complete its planned accrual. Another study (PMID 36967268) suggested that more chemotherapy cycles and higher dose intensity might lower recurrence, but the patient here completed their chemotherapy, so maybe that's accounted for.\n\nThe patient's CEA levels were around 4-5.8 ng/ml, which are slightly elevated but not extremely high. The MMR status is MSS, which might influence prognosis but isn't directly mentioned in the recurrence rates here. \n\nGiven the recent scans (up to age 67.282) showing no progression and the treatment received, along with the studies indicating that adjuvant chemo might not significantly change recurrence rates but the patient did receive treatment, the evidence leans towards no progression in the next 24 months. However, the PROCTOR-SCRIPT trial's 5-year follow-up showed 7.8% locoregional recurrence and 38.5% distant, but since the patient's follow-up is shorter, maybe the risk is lower. \n\nConsidering all factors, the answer is likely B) No.\n</think>\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"

        "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user is asking whether a 67.3-year-old patient with rectal adenocarcinoma will still be alive in the next 24 months. The options are A) Yes or B) No.\n\nFirst, I need to review the provided patient data. The patient's timeline and specimen information show that they were diagnosed at age 66.063 with rectal adenocarcinoma, stage 1-3. They underwent surgery and received adjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFOX (fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin) from age 66.310 to 66.504. Subsequent follow-ups, including CT scans and lab tests (like CEA levels), indicate no progression of cancer up to age 67.282. The latest entry is at age 67.282, where a MR scan shows no cancer presence.\n\nThe key points here are the absence of cancer progression in recent scans and the completion of chemotherapy. The patient's CEA levels have been within normal ranges (below 10 ng/ml), which is a good prognostic sign. The treatment response seems positive, with no evidence of disease in the latest assessments.\n\nLooking at the PubMed articles provided earlier, the PROCTOR-SCRIPT trial (PMID: 25480874) found that adjuvant chemotherapy didn't significantly improve overall survival in rectal cancer patients who had preoperative chemoradiotherapy. However, the patient in question didn't mention preoperative radiotherapy, so that might not apply here. Another study (PMID: 36967268) suggests that completing more chemotherapy cycles with adequate dose intensity improves recurrence-free survival. The patient completed their chemotherapy, which might contribute to a better outcome.\n\nThe patient's current status (up to 67.282 years old) shows no signs of recurrence, and the latest scans are negative. Assuming continued monitoring and no new symptoms, the prognosis seems favorable. While survival rates vary, the lack of progression and successful treatment suggest a higher likelihood of the patient surviving the next 24 months. Therefore, the answer leans towards A) Yes.\n</think>\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"
