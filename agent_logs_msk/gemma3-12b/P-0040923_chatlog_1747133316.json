This generally indicates a lower risk of rapid recurrence compared to MSI-High tumors.\n*   **Treatment:** Received chemotherapy (Capecitabine and Fluorouracil with Leucovorin).\n*   **CEA Levels:** Initial CEA was 0.9 ng/mL. After treatment, CEA increased to 3.1 ng/mL. An increasing CEA level can be a sign of recurrence, although it's not definitive.\n*   **CT Scans:** CT scans at 69.091 and 69.990 showed no evidence of progression.\n*   **Performance Status:** ECOG 0 (good performance status).\n\nConsidering these factors, the patient is currently showing no evidence of progression on imaging, but the rising CEA warrants attention. The MSS status and localized stage are generally favorable. However, the increased CEA suggests a possible developing issue. Given the patient's age and the fact that she has already undergone treatment, there is a possibility of recurrence.\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"

While the increasing CEA is concerning and could indicate early recurrence or other issues, the absence of visible progression on imaging is a significant factor. The patient's good performance status also suggests a reasonable ability to tolerate any potential treatment or manage any developing issues.\n\nGiven the lack of progression on imaging and the patient's good performance status, it's more likely that the CEA increase represents a slow, subclinical change or another factor, rather than rapid, overt progression in the next 12 months.\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"
