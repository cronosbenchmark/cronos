While the cancer has already recurred, the stability observed in recent scans is a positive sign. The CEA levels, while still elevated compared to baseline, have stabilized, suggesting that the current treatment regimen is at least controlling the disease. While cancer is unpredictable, the lack of progression for a year, combined with the ongoing treatment, improves the patient's prognosis. It's impossible to guarantee survival, but the current data suggests a reasonable chance of survival for the next 12 months.\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"
