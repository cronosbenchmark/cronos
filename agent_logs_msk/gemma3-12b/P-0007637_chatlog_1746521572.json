While elevated CEA can sometimes indicate recurrence, the lack of progression on imaging is a more significant factor.\n*   **Current Age:** The patient is currently 55.8 years old. The last recorded data is at 55.045 years old, so we have about 0.8 years of data missing.\n\nGiven the consistent lack of progression on CT scans and relatively stable CEA levels, the likelihood of recurrence within the next 18 months appears to be low.
