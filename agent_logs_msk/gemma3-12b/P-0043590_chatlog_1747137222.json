The scans after that point (60.977) do not provide enough information to determine if the progression has continued.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, I believe there is a reasonable chance of recurrence within the next 6 months.\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"

This indicates that the cancer has already begun to progress. While subsequent scans (60.977) don't provide enough information to determine if the progression has continued, the initial detection of bone metastasis strongly suggests that further progression is likely within the next 6 months. The patient is already experiencing progression, and without further treatment information, it's reasonable to assume this will continue.\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"
