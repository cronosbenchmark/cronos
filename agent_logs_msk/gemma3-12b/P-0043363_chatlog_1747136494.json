While previous scans showed no progression in the primary lung tumor, the development of a new lesion in the liver suggests that the cancer may be spreading. The fact that the scans up to 61.201 showed no progression is reassuring, but the new liver lesion changes the picture.\n\nGiven the new liver lesion, it is likely that the cancer will recur within the next 12 months.\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"

They are PD-L1 positive.\n*   **Stable Disease (60.001 - 61.201):**  Multiple CT scans and PET scans consistently showed no progression of the lung cancer from the initial diagnosis through age 61.201.\n*   **New Liver Lesion (61.201):** At age 61.201, a new lesion was detected in the liver.\n*   **Continued Stability (61.497 - 62.480):** Subsequent CT scans between ages 61.497 and 62.480 *again* confirmed no progression.\n*   **Current Age:** The patient is now 63 years old.\n\n**Assessment of Survival Probability:**\n\nPredicting survival is complex, but I will consider the available data. The patient's cancer was initially lung adenocarcinoma, which is a serious diagnosis. However, the cancer has been remarkably stable for over three years (from age 60 to 63). The new liver lesion is concerning, but the continued stability of the primary lung tumor and the absence of progression in the liver lesion over the last year are positive signs.\n\nWhile the liver lesion introduces uncertainty, the patient's overall stability suggests a reasonable chance of survival for the next 12 months. There's no indication in the provided data of any significant decline in health or other factors that would strongly suggest a negative outcome.\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"
