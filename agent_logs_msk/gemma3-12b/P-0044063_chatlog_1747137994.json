These are within a generally acceptable range, though elevated CEA can sometimes indicate recurrence.\n*   **MSI Status:** The tumor is microsatellite stable (MSS).\n*   **Performance Status:** ECOG performance status was 0 and 1 at different points.\n*   **Current Age:** The patient is currently 45.5 years old.\n\nGiven the consistent lack of progression on CT scans, stable CEA levels, and the patient's current performance status, the risk of recurrence within the next 12 months appears relatively low. While recurrence is always possible after colon cancer, the surveillance data doesn't suggest an imminent threat.\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"
