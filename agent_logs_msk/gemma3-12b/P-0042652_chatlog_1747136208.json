The last treatment (Capecitabine/Oxaliplatin) stopped around age 77.360.\n*   **Recent Scans (77.152, 77.248, 77.374, 77.398):** Recent CT and PET scans (within the last 6 months) show no evidence of progression.\n*   **CEA Levels:** CEA levels have decreased significantly from 7.9000 ng/ml to 1.1000 ng/ml.\n*   **MSI Status:** The tumor is microsatellite stable (MSS).\n\n**Tumor Characteristics (specimen.txt):**\n\n*   **Cancer Type:** Colon Adenocarcinoma\n*   **Stage:** Stage 1-3\n*   **TMB:** TMB is 9.0238\n*   **Tumor Purity:** 30%\n*   **Pathological Group:** 3B\n\n**Assessment:**\n\nGiven the recent scans showing no progression, the decreasing CEA levels, and the patient's current age (77.4), the likelihood of recurrence within the next 12 months appears to be relatively low. While the stage (Stage 1-3) and pathological group (3B) indicate a potential for recurrence, the recent negative scans and decreasing tumor markers are encouraging.

This is a very important factor.\n*   **CEA Levels (timeline0.txt):** CEA levels have *decreased* significantly.

These factors do indicate a potential for progression, but are outweighed by the recent scan results.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\nThe most recent scans and decreasing CEA levels strongly suggest that the cancer is *not* currently progressing. While the tumor characteristics (stage, group, etc.) do carry a risk of future progression, the absence of evidence of progression on recent imaging is the most critical factor.\n\n[ANSWER: B]"
