Initially, there was evidence of metastasis to the liver and potentially other abdominal sites. He underwent treatment with FOLFOX (fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) from approximately 70.0 to 70.3. CT scans throughout the period (69.6 - 70.4) consistently showed no progression of the cancer. CEA levels, a tumor marker, decreased from 13.7 ng/mL at age 69.8 to 1.5 ng/mL at age 70.4. The most recent scan at 70.4 also showed no progression.\n\nGiven the lack of progression on imaging, decreasing CEA levels, and the completion of chemotherapy, the likelihood of recurrence within the next 12 months appears to be relatively low. While recurrence is always possible with Stage IV cancer, the current data suggests stability.\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"

At 70.4, the patient showed no evidence of progression on CT scans and had decreasing CEA levels after completing FOLFOX chemotherapy. There is no information available regarding the period between 70.4 and 70.5.\n\nWithout any new information regarding the patient's condition since 70.4, and given the previously observed stability, it's reasonable to assume that the cancer is unlikely to progress significantly in the next 12 months.

The patient is 69.5 years old when diagnosed with Stage IV colon adenocarcinoma with liver metastasis. He underwent FOLFOX chemotherapy, which concluded around 70.3. At 70.4, there was no evidence of progression and decreasing CEA levels. However, the timeline doesn't provide information about the patient's overall health beyond the cancer itself, nor does it include any information about prognosis or life expectancy estimates.\n\nStage IV colon cancer has a generally poor prognosis. However, with treatment, some patients can live for several years. The fact that the patient completed chemotherapy and showed no progression at 70.4 is a positive sign. However, without further information about his overall health, comorbidities, and any potential complications, it's impossible to definitively predict his survival over the next 18 months.\n\nGiven the limited information and the serious nature of Stage IV cancer, I must err on the side of caution.
