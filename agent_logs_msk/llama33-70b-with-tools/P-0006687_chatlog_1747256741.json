Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0006687-T01-IM5\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0006687\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Colorectal Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Sigmoid Colon\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Colon Adenocarcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT410\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 1390, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 20.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"COAD\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

The tumor sample analysis reveals a microsatellite stable (MSS) status with a low MSI score of 0.21, indicating a lower likelihood of high-frequency microsatellite instability-associated mutations.\n\nThe patient has undergone treatment with a combination of oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and fluorouracil (FOLFOX regimen), which is a standard treatment for colorectal cancer. The treatment started at the age of 53.575 and included multiple cycles of chemotherapy.\n\nThe patient's clinical history, as detailed in [FILE: timeline0.txt], shows that at the age of 53.544, a CT scan revealed that the cancer had not progressed. However, at the age of 53.947, another CT scan indicated cancer progression. Subsequent scans and lab tests, including CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) levels, were performed to monitor the disease progression and response to treatment.\n\nGiven this information, to predict the likelihood of cancer recurrence within the next 12 months, I need to consider the patient's current stage of cancer, the effectiveness of the treatment, and the patient's overall health condition.\n\nSince the patient has stage IV cancer and has undergone treatment, the risk of recurrence is present. However, the fact that the cancer was found to be stable (MSS) and the patient has been treated with a FOLFOX regimen, which is effective in reducing recurrence rates, suggests a relatively lower risk of recurrence in the short term.\n\nAdditionally, the patient's CEA levels have been monitored and were found to be relatively stable, ranging from 1.1 to 1.8 ng/ml, which might indicate a relatively lower risk of active cancer cells.\n\nConsidering these factors, I would estimate that the risk of cancer recurrence within the next 12 months is lower but not negligible.\n\n[ANSWER: B]"

important for the survival and proliferation of cancer cells.[A192939,A192837,A192891,A193275] VEGF plays an important role in angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, and tumor growth, which are all factors that contribute to its attractiveness as a therapeutic target for anti-cancer therapies.[A192834,A192888,A192837,A192891,A192894] \r\n\r\nIn 2004, bevacizumab (Avastin) gained FDA approval for specific types of cancer, and became the first antiangiogenic agent introduced to the market.[A193272,A193275] It is a humanized monoclonal IgG antibody, and inhibits angiogenesis by binding and neutralizing VEGF-A.[A192888,A192939] Bevacizumab is generally indicated for use in combination with different chemotherapy regimens which are specific to the type, severity, and stage of cancer.[L12648] Bevacizumab was approved by Health Canada on March 24, 2010 and by the European Commission on April 21, 2021.[L45793,L43130] There are several biosimilars of bevacizumab, such as bevacizumab-awwb, bevacizumab-maly, bevacizumab-adcd, and bevacizumab-tnjn. \r\n\r\nInterestingly, researchers have identified higher VEGF expression in patients with COVID-19, which may contribute to lung pathologies including acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI).[L12699] As such, bevacizumab is being investigated for the treatment of lung complications associated with severe cases of COVID-19.[L12699]\nFloxuridine: An antineoplastic antimetabolite that is metabolized to fluorouracil when administered by rapid injection. Floxuridine is available as a sterile, nonpyrogenic, lyophilized powder for reconstitution. When administered by slow, continuous, intra-arterial infusion, it is converted to floxuridine monophosphate. It has been used to treat hepatic metastases of gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and for palliation in malignant neoplasms of the liver and gastrointestinal tract.\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nUridine: nan\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

The aim of the present study was to determine whether elevated pre-operative and post-operative CEA values are useful prognostic biomarkers for patients with stage I-III colon cancer who underwent surgery with curative intent. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study in patients with histologically confirmed stage I-III primary colonic adenocarcinoma who underwent radical surgical resection at Mexico's National Cancer Institute, between January 2008 and January 2020. We determined pre-operative and post-operative CEA and analyzed the association of scores with poorer survival outcomes in patients with resected colon cancer, considering overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS: We included 640 patients with stage I-III colon cancer. Pre-operative CEA levels were in the normal range in 460 patients (group A) and above the reference value in the other 180. Of the latter, 134 presented normalized CEA levels after surgery, but 46 (group C) continued to show CEA levels above the reference values after surgery. Therefore, propensity score matching (PSM) was carried out to reduce the bias. Patients were adjusted at a 1:1:1 ratio with 46 in each group, to match the number in the smallest group. Median follow- up was 46.4 months (range, 4.9-147.4 months). Median DFS was significantly shorter in Group C: 55.5 months (95% CI 39.6-71.3) than in the other two groups [Group A: 77.1 months (95% CI 72.6-81.6). Group B: 75.7 months (95% CI 66.8-84.5) (p-value < 0.001)]. Overall survival was also significantly worse in group C [57.1 (95% CI 37.8-76.3) months] than in group A [82.8 (95% CI 78.6-86.9 months] and group B [87.1 (95% CI 79.6-94.5 months] (p-value = 0.002). To identify whether change in CEA levels operative and post-surgery was an independent prognostic factor for survival outcomes, a Cox proportional hazard model was applied. In multivariate analysis, change in CEA level was a statistically significant, independent prognostic factor for overall survival (p-value = 0.031). CONCLUSIONS: When assessed collectively, pre-operative and post-operative CEA values are useful biomarkers for predicting survival outcomes in patients with resected colon cancer. Prognoses are worse for patients with elevated pre-operative and post-surgical CEA values, but similar in patients with normal post-surgical values, regardless of their pre-surgery values.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 37155318\nTitle: Cytoreductive Surgery and Hyperthermic Peritoneal Chemotherapy in Appendiceal and Colorectal Cancer: Outcomes and Survival.\nAuthors: Djadou TM, Poh KS, Yellinek S\nJournal: The American surgeon\nPublication Date: 2023 Dec\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: We reviewed outcomes following cytoreductive surgery/hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) for patients with appendiceal or colorectal neoplasms and evaluated key prognostic indicators for treatment. METHODS: All patients who underwent cytoreductive surgery/HIPEC for appendiceal and colorectal neoplasms were identified from an IRB-approved database. Patient demographics, operative reports, and postoperative outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS: 110 patients [median age 54.5 (18-79) years, 55% male] were included. Primary tumor location was colorectal (58; 52.7%) and appendiceal (52; 47.3%). 28.2%, .9%, and 12.7% had right, left, and sigmoid tumors, respectively; 11.8% had rectal tumors. 12/13 rectal cancer patients underwent preoperative radiotherapy. Mean Peritoneal Cancer Index was 9.6 +/- 7.7; complete cytoreduction was achieved in 90.9%. 53.6% developed postoperative complications. Reoperation, perioperative mortality, and 30-day readmission rates were 1.8%, .09%, and 13.6%, respectively. Recurrence at a median of 11.1 months was 48.2%; overall survival at 1 and 2 years was 84% and 56.8%, respectively; disease-free survival was 60.8% and 33.7%, respectively, at a median follow-up of 16.8 (0-86.8) months. Univariate analysis of preoperative chemotherapy, primary malignancy location, primary tumor perforated or obstructive, postoperative bleeding complication, and pathology of adenocarcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma and negative lymph nodes were identified as possible predictive factors of survival. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that preoperative chemotherapy (P < .001), perforated tumor (P = .003), and postoperative intra-abdominal bleeding (P < .001) were independent prognostic indicators for survival. CONCLUSIONS: Cytoreductive surgery/HIPEC for colorectal and appendiceal neoplasms has low mortality and high completeness of cytoreduction score. Preoperative chemotherapy, primary tumor perforation, and postoperative bleeding are adverse risk factors for survival.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 35740558\nTitle: Localized Small Bowel Adenocarcinoma Management: Evidence Summary.\nAuthors: Turpin A, El Amrani M, Zaanan A\nJournal: Cancers\nPublication Date: 2022 Jun 11\nAbstract: Small bowel cancers are rare diseases whose prognosis is poorer than that of colon cancers. Due to disease rarity, there is little data on small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA) treatment, and most recommendations come from expert agreements or analogies to the management of colon cancer. Although relatively high rates of local recurrence are observed for duodenal malignancies, distant metastatic relapse remains common and requires adjuvant systemic therapy. Given the similarities between SBA and colorectal cancer, radiotherapy and chemotherapy strategies used for the latter disease are frequently pursued for the former disease, specifically for tumors located in the duodenum. However, no previous randomized study has evaluated the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy on the overall survival of SBA patients. Most previous studies on treatment outcomes and prognostic factors in this context were based on large international databases, such as the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results or the National Cancer Database. Studies are required to establish and validate prognostic and predictive markers relevant in this context to inform the use of (neo) adjuvant treatment. Among those, deficient mismatch repair tumors represent 20% of SBAs, but their impact on chemosensitivity remains unknown. Herein, we summarize the current evidence on the management of localized SBA, including future perspectives.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

\n\n[DrugBank: Bevacizumab: There is a great deal of evidence indicating that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is important for the survival and proliferation of cancer cells.[A192939,A192837,A192891,A193275] VEGF plays an important role in angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, and tumor growth, which are all factors that contribute to its attractiveness as a therapeutic target for anti-cancer therapies.[A192834,A192888,A192837,A192891,A192894] \r\n\r\nIn 2004, bevacizumab (Avastin) gained FDA approval for specific types of cancer, and became the first antiangiogenic agent introduced to the market.[A193272,A193275] It is a humanized monoclonal IgG antibody, and inhibits angiogenesis by binding and neutralizing VEGF-A.[A192888,A192939] Bevacizumab is generally indicated for use in combination with different chemotherapy regimens which are specific to the type, severity, and stage of cancer.[L12648] Bevacizumab was approved by Health Canada on March 24, 2010 and by the European Commission on April 21, 2021.[L45793,L43130] There are several biosimilars of bevacizumab, such as bevacizumab-awwb, bevacizumab-maly, bevacizumab-adcd, and bevacizumab-tnjn. \r\n\r\nInterestingly, researchers have identified higher VEGF expression in patients with COVID-19, which may contribute to lung pathologies including acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI).[L12699] As such, bevacizumab is being investigated for the treatment of lung complications associated with severe cases of COVID-19.[L12699]\nFloxuridine: An antineoplastic antimetabolite that is metabolized to fluorouracil when administered by rapid injection. Floxuridine is available as a sterile, nonpyrogenic, lyophilized powder for reconstitution. When administered by slow, continuous, intra-arterial infusion, it is converted to floxuridine monophosphate. It has been used to treat hepatic metastases of gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and for palliation in malignant neoplasms of the liver and gastrointestinal tract.\nOxaliplatin: Oxaliplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nUridine: nan\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0006687-T01-IM5\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0006687\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Colorectal Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Sigmoid Colon\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Colon Adenocarcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT410\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 1390, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 20.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"COAD\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).
