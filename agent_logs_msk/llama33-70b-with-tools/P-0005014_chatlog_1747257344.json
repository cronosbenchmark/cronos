9-residue peptide analogue of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Unlike the endogenous decapeptide GnRH, leuprolide contains a single D-amino acid (D-leucyl) residue, which helps to increase its circulating half-life from three to four minutes to approximately three hours.[A203222] As a GnRH mimic, leuprolide is capable of binding to the GnRH receptor (GnRHR) and inducing downstream modulation of both gonadotropin hormone and sex steroid levels. Prolonged activation of GnRHR results in significant downregulation of sex steroid levels, which is primarily responsible for the clinical efficacy of leuprolide in diverse conditions, including advanced prostate cancer, endometriosis, and central precocious puberty.[A203126, A203132]\r\n\r\nLeuprolide was first approved in 1985 as a daily subcutaneous injection under the tradename Lupron\u2122 by Abbvie Endocrine Inc.[L13850] Since this initial approval, various long-acting intramuscular and subcutaneous products have been developed such that patients can be dosed once every six months.[L13781, L13790] Leuprolide remains frontline therapy in all conditions for which it is indicated for use.\nBicalutamide: Bicalutamide is an oral non-steroidal anti-androgen for prostate cancer. It is comprised of a racemic mixture that is a 50:50 composition of the (R)-bicalutamide and (S)-bicalutamide enantionmers.

METHODS: Eighty-five consecutive patients categorized as intermediate (17.5%) and high risk (82.5%) of failure after definitive therapy for carcinoma of prostate according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) underwent RP between 1989 and 1997. Median preoperative PSA was 26 ng/ml (range 15 ng/ml-91 ng/ml). Fifty-nine patients (70%) received three months neoadjuvant hormone therapy. Thirty-six patients (42%) underwent early (three to four months after RP) adjuvant radiation for pT3 disease and/or positive surgical margins. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 58 months (range 12-104 months). There was no difference in the biochemical recurrence rate between the intermediate and high-risk group of patients. The overall relapse rate was 33%. Cancer-specific mortality was 3.5%. Patients with T1c tumors had a significantly lower biochemical recurrence rate (bRR) (7%) compared to palpable tumors (p = 0.03). Age above 65 was a significant negative prognostic factor with respect to biochemical recurrence (p = 0.01). Adjuvant radiation was associated with biochemical recurrence rates of 25% vs. 40% in patients who were not radiated (p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In the intermediate and high-risk groups of patients with nonpalpable prostate cancer, RP and adjuvant RT may provide a biochemical recurrence-free rate (bRFR) comparable to that reported in other series with RP alone on patients in the low-risk groups. We encourage the multimodality treatment approach incorporating adjuvant postoperative radiation in these patients.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 21437569\nTitle: Risk-stratified survival rates and predictors of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy in a Nara, Japan, cohort study.\nAuthors: Tanaka N, Fujimoto K, Hirayama A\nJournal: International journal of clinical oncology\nPublication Date: 2011 Oct\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the oncological outcomes in patients who underwent radical prostatectomy in various risk groups. METHODS: The subjects were 468 patients with clinically localized or locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the prostate (T1-3N0M0) who underwent retropubic radical prostatectomy with/without neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant therapy at Nara Medical University and its affiliated hospitals between January 1997 and December 2006. All patients were stratified by D'Amico risk classification. The independent predictor of biochemical recurrence was determined in each risk group. RESULTS: Of all 468 patients, 171 patients showed biochemical recurrence during a mean follow-up period of 53 months. The 5-year estimated biochemical recurrence-free survival rates in the low, intermediate, and high-risk groups were 77.3, 71.3, and 46.3%, respectively. The multivariate analysis using Cox's proportional hazard model showed that patient age in the low-risk group, seminal vesicle involvement in the intermediate-risk group, and prostate-specific antigen value at diagnosis, surgical Gleason score, percent positive core, and perineural invasion in the high-risk group were independent predictors of biochemical recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: The high-risk patients showed a significant higher biochemical recurrence than the low- and intermediate-risk patients. The independent predictor of biochemical recurrence was different in each risk group.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 8635067\nTitle: Surgery with adjuvant irradiation in patients with pathologic stage C adenocarcinoma of the prostate.\nAuthors: Petrovich Z, Lieskovsky G, Freeman J\nJournal: Cancer\nPublication Date: 1995 Nov 1\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: In recent years, the routine use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) to detect cancer of the prostate (CaP) early has renewed the controversy regarding radiotherapy versus radical prostatectomy as the superior definitive treatment. Radiotherapy alone has been reported to result in a high incidence of local recurrence, whereas on the other hand surgical treatment has resulted in a high incidence of microscopic residual tumor. The purpose of this study was to review our treatment results with radical prostatectomy followed by planned courses of postoperative irradiation in patients with pathologic Stage (PS) C disease. METHODS: From 1972 to 1989, 95 patients with CaP with PS C tumors were treated with radical prostatectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy. Pathologic stage distribution was: C1 in 26 (27%), C2 in 37 (39%), and C3 in 32 (34%) patients. The median follow-up was 6 years. All 95 study patients received postoperative pelvic irradiation as the only adjuvant treatment. Radiotherapy treated volume included the prostatic fossa and its immediate vicinity. The RT dose ranged from 33 Gy to 61.8 Gy (median, 45 Gy). RESULTS: The overall 5- and 10-year actuarial survival rates were 94% and 73%, respectively, with the 5 and 10 year disease specific survival of 98% and 91%, respectively. Clinical and/or prostate specific antigen recurrence was 31% at 5 years and 44% at 10 years. Prostate specific antigen elevation without clinical evidence of recurrent disease was recorded in 26 (27%) patients. Seminal vesicle involvement (C3) and high Gleason's score (8-10) were the most important factors predicting recurrence. Of the 95 patients treated, 2 had pelvic recurrence alone and 1 had local and distant metastatic disease. Radiotherapy was well tolerated with no clinically important morbidity. CONCLUSION: Based on this experience, moderate dose adjuvant radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy in patients with PS C CaP is recommended.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

This study retrospectively examined prostate adenocarcinoma in Japanese patients 80 years of age or older to determine the natural history and prognosis of this malignancy in the elderly population. METHODS: The medical records of 593 patients were reviewed, with respect to age, histologic grade, clinical and pathological stage, treatment modality and clinical outcome. A variety of possible clinical factors were compared between patient groups > or = 80 and < 80 years old. RESULTS: No significant difference in clinical stage, tumor grade, and performance status (PS) was found between two age groups of patients with prostate cancer. A significant stage migration between pre-PSA era and PSA era was found only in the group < 80 years old. In the series of stage D2 cancer patients, while there was no significant difference in cause-specific and progression-free survival rates between the two groups, the younger group < 80 years old had a better marker response at 3 months from the start of endocrine therapy compared with the older group (P = 0.0048, chi2 analysis). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that patients > or = 80 years with prostate cancer present with similar histologic grade and disease stage as younger patients, although the younger group with stage D2 had a better marker response to endocrine therapy.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 10189135\nTitle: Predictors of cancer progression in T1a prostate adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Cheng L, Bergstralh EJ, Scherer BG\nJournal: Cancer\nPublication Date: 1999 Mar 15\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: The biologic behavior of T1a prostate adenocarcinoma is variable. A critical issue in the management of patients with T1a prostate adenocarcinoma is to distinguish those who will develop cancer progression from those who will not. Predictive factors that identify those at high risk of cancer progression are needed to stratify patients for treatment. In the current study the authors attempted to identify such predictors of cancer progression in a large series of untreated patients with lengthy follow-up. METHODS: The authors studied 102 patients who were diagnosed with T1a prostate adenocarcinoma (incidental tumor involving < or = 5% of the resected prostatic tissue) at the time they underwent transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) at the Mayo Clinic between 1960-1970. None of these patients were treated. Patient ages ranged from 48-91 years (mean +/- standard deviation, 69 +/- 7 years). The average weight of the resected prostate tissue was 24 +/- 18 g (range, 3-115 g; median, 18 g). Tumor volume was measured by the grid method. Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify factors associated with cancer progression. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Five-year and 10-year progression free survival rates were 93% and 87%, respectively. During the mean follow-up of 9.5 +/- 6.8 years (range, 0.3-31 years; median, 9.0 years), 14 patients developed clinical cancer progression, including 5 patients with systemic progression (1 with distant metastases and 4 who died of prostate adenocarcinoma). The interval from diagnosis to clinical cancer progression ranged from 1-23 years (mean, 7.3 years). The amount of resected prostate tissue (TURP weight) was associated with progression (P = 0.04). Patients with a TURP weight > or = 30 g had 100% progression free survival at 10 years compared with a progression free survival rate of 73% in patients with a TURP weight < 12 g. Gleason score, tumor volume, number of chips involved by tumor, number of tumor foci, and the presence of high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia were not significant in predicting cancer progression. There was a trend toward a worse prognosis with the increasing number of chips involved by cancer (P = 0.16). Patients with < 3 chips involved by cancer had a 88% 10-year progression free survival rate compared with 73% in patients with > or = 3 chips involved by cancer. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical course of T1a prostate adenocarcinoma is variable. If left untreated, a small but significant proportion of patients are at risk for disease progression and death. However, the current study found that patients with a TURP weight > or = 30 g have an excellent prognosis and can be managed conservatively.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 9445192\nTitle: Watchful waiting or watchful progression?: Prostate specific antigen doubling times and clinical behavior in patients with early untreated prostate carcinoma.\nAuthors: McLaren DB, McKenzie M, Duncan G\nJournal: Cancer\nPublication Date: 1998 Jan 15\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Prostate specific antigen doubling time (PSAdt) is a dynamic model of prostate tumor biology. It predicts aggressive disease and subsequent clinical recurrence after radical treatment. However, as yet there is only limited evidence for its validity in the watchful waiting population. METHODS: One hundred and thirteen previously untreated patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate who were referred to the British Columbia Cancer Agency for a management opinion subsequently were placed into a prospective watchful waiting program. The reasons for watchful waiting, previous medical history, serial PSA, and histopathologic data were recorded. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 75 years (range, 49-85 years). The median follow-up from the time of the first appointment was 14 months (range, 0-58 months). The reasons for watchful waiting were correlated highly with T classification (P = 0.003) and past medical history (P = 0.002). Approximately 40% of T1 patients and 51% of T2 patients had clinical progression by 2 years, increasing to 60% at 3 years. On multivariate analysis PSAdt strongly correlated with clinical progression (P < 0.0001), stage progression (P = 0.01), and time to treatment (P = 0.0001); tumor grade and initial stage were not found to be predictive for any of the endpoints studied. Initial PSA only was significant in predicting for time to treatment (P = 0.03). Approximately 50% of patients with a PSAdt of <18 months progressed within 6 months. At last follow-up, no deaths from prostate carcinoma had been recorded. Overall survival at 2 and 5 years was 92% and 68%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Using digital rectal examination, the findings of this study demonstrated high rates of clinical tumor progression within the watchful waiting population. PSAdt rather than standard histopathologic criteria was found to be the most powerful indicator of disease activity.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

The average follow up was 4.9 years. The patients were aged 44-87 years (median 69 years) and all had histopathological evidence of adenocarcinoma by needle biopsy or transurethral resection of prostate. The histopathological grading was: 127 G1; 154 G2; 127 G4; 28 Gx. Clinical staging according to TNM (American Urological Association) was: 29 T0 (A2); 4 T1 (B1); 173 T2 (B2); 176 T3 (C1); 63 T4 (C2); 3 Tx. Routine surgical pelvic lymph node staging was not performed but patients had radiological (computerized tomography scan or lymphogram) nodal staging: 350 N0; 22 N1; 12 N2; 64 Nx. High energy linear accelerator external beam radiotherapy was given by multiple fields to total doses of 50-70 Gy (median 60 Gy). The majority of patients (307, 69%) was treated by a uniform policy under the care of one radiation oncologist (HM). The rates of local and distant failure at 5 years were 10% (s.e. = 2%) and 42% (s.e. = 3%), respectively. The late complication rate at 5 years was 25% (s.e. = 2%), comprising mild 16%, moderate 7% and severe 1.3%. The 5 year overall survival rate was 64% (s.e. = 2%) and the cancer-specific survival rate was 74% (s.e. = 3%).

The survival rate and prognostic factors of CCPC are still unclear and deserve further study. We downloaded data on prostate cancer from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database for 1975-2019. After inclusion and exclusion criteria, we compared APC and analyzed cancer-specific mortality (CSM) and overall mortality (OM) in CCPC patients and prognostic risk factors using a propensity score matching (PSM) study and multivariate Cox regression. We included 408,004 cases of APC as a control group and 130 cases of CCPC as a case group. Compared with APC patients, the incidence of CCPC was extremely low, and the median age of diagnosis was older (72.00 years vs. 69.00 years, p < 0.01). In addition, more rates were diagnosed at an earlier stage (1975-1998, 93.1% vs. 50.2%, p < 0.001), more unstaged or unknown stage ratios (87.7% vs. 42.7%, p < 0.001), and more surgical treatments (66.2% vs. 47.6%, p < 0.001), but the prognosis of CCPC patients was worse. After PSM, the median survival time of CCPC patients was shorter (57.50 month vs. 88.00 month, p < 0.01), the rate of CSM was higher (41.5% vs. 27.7%, p < 0.05), and the rate of OM was higher (99.2% vs. 90.8%, p < 0.01). In the adjusted model 2 after PSM, the CSM risk of CCPC patients reached HR 1.76 (95%CI 1.13-2.72), which was 76% higher than that of APC patients (p < 0.05). It was further found that surgical treatment might benefit CSM in CCPC patients (HR 0.39, 95%CI 0.18-0.82, p < 0.05) in Univariate analysis, but it was insignificant in further multivariate analysis. This is the first large-scale case-control report on the survival risk and prognostic factors of CCPC patients. We found that the prognosis of CCPC patients was significantly worse than that of APC. Surgery might be an effective treatment that may improve its prognosis.

This study retrospectively examined prostate adenocarcinoma in Japanese patients 80 years of age or older to determine the natural history and prognosis of this malignancy in the elderly population. METHODS: The medical records of 593 patients were reviewed, with respect to age, histologic grade, clinical and pathological stage, treatment modality and clinical outcome. A variety of possible clinical factors were compared between patient groups > or = 80 and < 80 years old. RESULTS: No significant difference in clinical stage, tumor grade, and performance status (PS) was found between two age groups of patients with prostate cancer. A significant stage migration between pre-PSA era and PSA era was found only in the group < 80 years old. In the series of stage D2 cancer patients, while there was no significant difference in cause-specific and progression-free survival rates between the two groups, the younger group < 80 years old had a better marker response at 3 months from the start of endocrine therapy compared with the older group (P = 0.0048, chi2 analysis). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that patients > or = 80 years with prostate cancer present with similar histologic grade and disease stage as younger patients, although the younger group with stage D2 had a better marker response to endocrine therapy.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 30224545\nTitle: The Aged Microenvironment Influences the Tumorigenic Potential of Malignant Prostate Epithelial Cells.\nAuthors: Bianchi-Frias D, Damodarasamy M, Hernandez SA\nJournal: Molecular cancer research : MCR\nPublication Date: 2019 Jan\nAbstract: The incidence of prostate cancer is directly linked to age, but age-associated changes that facilitate prostate cancer development and progression are poorly understood. This study investigated age-related changes in the prostate microenvironment for their influence on prostate cancer behavior. Prostate cancer cells implanted orthotopically into the prostate demonstrated accelerated tumor growth in aged compared with young mice. Metastatic lesions following intravenous injection were also more numerous in aged mice. Tumors from young and aged mice showed no significant differences concerning their proliferation index, apoptosis, or angiogenesis. However, analysis of tumor-infiltrating immune cells by IHC and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed elevated numbers of macrophages in prostates from aged mice, which are quickly polarized towards a phenotype resembling protumorigenic tumor-associated macrophages upon tumor cell engraftment. Older patients with prostate cancer (>60 years old) in The Cancer Genome Atlas Prostate Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-PRAD) dataset displayed higher expression of macrophage markers (CD163 and VSIG4) which associated with higher rates of biochemical relapse. Remodeling of the collagenous extracellular matrix (ECM) was associated with prostate cancer growth and invasion in the aged microenvironment. Moreover, the collagen matrix extracted from aged mice enhanced the invasiveness and proliferation of prostate cancer cells in vitro. Together, these results demonstrate that the aged prostatic microenvironment can regulate the growth and metastasis of malignant prostate cells, highlighting the role of resident macrophages and their polarization towards a protumorigenic phenotype, along with remodeling of the ECM. IMPLICATIONS: These findings demonstrate the importance of age-associated tumor microenvironment alterations in regulating key aspects of prostate cancer progression.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 29992241\nTitle: Pembrolizumab for advanced prostate adenocarcinoma: findings of the KEYNOTE-028 study.\nAuthors: Hansen AR, Massard C, Ott PA\nJournal: Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology\nPublication Date: 2018 Aug 1\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer derive only modest clinical benefit from available therapies. Blockade of the inhibitory programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor by monoclonal antibodies has been effective in several malignancies. Results from the prostate adenocarcinoma cohort of the nonrandomized phase Ib KEYNOTE-028 trial of pembrolizumab in advanced solid tumors are presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Key eligibility criteria included advanced prostate adenocarcinoma, unsuccessful standard therapy, measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), and PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) expression in >/=1% of tumor or stromal cells. Patients received pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks until disease progression or intolerable toxicity for up to 24 months. Primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 by investigator review. RESULTS: Median patient age in this cohort (n = 23) was 65 years; 73.9% of patients received at least two prior therapies for metastatic disease. There were four confirmed partial responses, for an ORR of 17.4% [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.0%-38.8%]; 8 of 23 (34.8%) patients had stable disease. Median duration of response was 13.5 months. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 3.5 and 7.9 months, respectively; 6-month PFS and OS rates were 34.8% and 73.4%, respectively. One patient remained on treatment at data cutoff. After a median follow-up of 7.9 months, 14 (60.9%) patients experienced treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), most commonly nausea (n = 3, 13.0%). Four (17.3%) experienced grade 3/4 TRAEs: grade 3 peripheral neuropathy, grade 3 asthenia, grade 3 fatigue, and grade 4 lipase increase. No pembrolizumab-related deaths or discontinuations occurred. CONCLUSION: Pembrolizumab resulted in durable objective response in a subset of patients with heavily pretreated, advanced PD-L1-positive prostate cancer, and its side effect profile was favorable.
