This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and prognostic factors for camrelizumab plus carboplatin and pemetrexed (CP) chemotherapy in treating patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma. METHODS: Of 51 advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients with negative driver genes who received camrelizumab plus CP chemotherapy were recruited. These patients received four cycles of camrelizumab plus CP chemotherapy in a 21-day cycle. Then, camrelizumab, pemetrexed or camrelizumab plus pemetrexed was administered as maintenance therapy. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The rates of complete response, partial response, stable disease and progressive disease were 2.0%, 56.8%, 19.6% and 5.9%, respectively; while treatment response of 15.7% of patients was missing or not evaluable. The objective response and disease control rates were 58.8% and 78.4%, respectively. With a median follow-up period of 14.9 months (the follow-up duration ranged from 3.9 months to 24.3 months), 41 (83.4%) cases of disease progression and 22 (43.1%) cases of death were recorded. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 10.5 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 8.4-12.6 months) with a 1-year PFS rate of 36.3% and a 2-year PFS rate of 7.5%. In addition, the median overall survival (OS) was 18.7 months (95% CI: 16.4-21.0 months) with a 1-year OS rate of 79.1% and a 2-year OS rate of 30.4%. In consideration of safety, the most frequent adverse events were peripheral neuropathy (37.3%), neutropenia (37.3%), alopecia (35.3%), etc. and most of them were grade 1-2 and could be controlled. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Camrelizumab plus CP chemotherapy achieves favourable efficacy and tolerable adverse events in advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 23112957\nTitle: Maintenance treatment with chemotherapy and immunotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer: a case report.\nAuthors: Llanos A, Savignano M, Cinat G\nJournal: Frontiers in oncology\nPublication Date: 2012\nAbstract: A 53-years-old woman was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma state IV (synchronous pleural involvement) in April 2009. First-line systemic treatment included six cycles of Carboplatin, Paclitaxel, and Bevacizumab. Partial response was achieved. Maintenance therapy with Bevacizumab and Pemetrexed was given from September 2009 to February 2010. No response changes were observed. Immunotherapy was initiated, and then Pemetrexed was given with the same disease status. Both treatments were well tolerated. Immunotherapy toxicity included reaction at the site of injection grade 2. At present, the patient is still on this treatment. Given the poor prognosis of patients with advanced lung cancer, the combination of both treatments during the stable phase of the disease may improve progression-free survival.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 30027579\nTitle: Efficacy of pemetrexed and carboplatin with or without bevacizumab in lung adenocarcinoma patients with EGFR non-T790M mutations after progression on first-line EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors.\nAuthors: Jiang Z, Zhang Y, Yang Y\nJournal: Thoracic cancer\nPublication Date: 2018 Sep\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of pemetrexed and carboplatin plus bevacizumab (PC + B) versus pemetrexed and carboplatin (PC) in lung adenocarcinoma patients with EGFR non-T790M mutations after progression on first-line EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). METHODS: Patients with EGFR-positive lung adenocarcinoma who had received second-line PC with or without bevacizumab harboring EGFR non-T790M mutations after progression on first-line EGFR-TKIs between April 2015 and 2017 at Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital were enrolled in the study. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival and secondary endpoints were overall survival, objective response rate, disease control rate, and safety. RESULTS: A total of 85 patients were eligible for the study: 55 and 30 cases were enrolled in the PC and PC + B groups, respectively. The median progression-free survival was prolonged with PC + B compared to PC (median 8.2 vs. 5.1 months; P = 0.037). The objective response rate was improved with PC + B compared to PC (46.7% vs. 25.5%; P = 0.047) and overall survival prolonged with PC + B compared to PC (median 26.3 vs. 19.2 months; P = 0.012). Safety was similar to previous studies of bevacizumab in non-small cell lung cancer: one patient experienced grade 3 hypertension and proteinuria but did not require the discontinuation of therapy. CONCLUSION: The addition of bevacizumab to PC was superior to PC alone as second-line therapy in patients with advanced non-T90M EGFR-positive lung adenocarcinoma. However, this result needs to be confirmed by prospective clinical trials.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

This multicenter, single-arm, phase II study included 62 patients (>/=70 years) with chemonaive advanced NSCLC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) 0-1, and assigned to receive 6 cycles of 3-weekly pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) and carboplatin AUC 5. The primary endpoint was objective tumor response rate (ORR). Sixty-two patients received at least one dose of chemotherapy. Median age was 76.4 years [70.2-86] and all patients had PS 0 (16.1%) or PS 1 (83.9%). Stage IIIb disease in 21% patients and stage IV in 79% patients. Non-squamous cell carcinoma in 66.1% patients (adenocarcinoma 51.6%, large cell carcinoma 8.1%, other 6.5%) and squamous cell carcinoma in 33.9% patients. ORR was 28.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 16.58-43.26), all were partial responses. Stable disease rate was 42.9%. Grade 3/4 toxicities related to study drugs were: asthenia 16.1%, anorexia 4.8%, diarrhea 3.2%, neutropenia 51.6%, leucopenia 30.7%, thrombocytopenia 29%, anemia 19.4%. One related fatal septic shock occurred. In advanced NSCLC, pemetrexed use is restricted to non-squamous histology. The combination pemetrexed-carboplatin could be a valuable treatment option in elderly patients. Neutropenia was the most common toxicity. The ORR is within the range of data reported for pemetrexed-carboplatin in the general NSCLC population (24-31%).\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 26700505\nTitle: Phase 2 trial of neoadjuvant bevacizumab plus pemetrexed and carboplatin in patients with unresectable stage III lung adenocarcinoma (GASTO 1001).\nAuthors: Ou W, Li N, Wang SY\nJournal: Cancer\nPublication Date: 2016 Mar 1\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: The objective of this phase 2 trial was to assess the efficacy and safety of induction bevacizumab plus chemotherapy followed by surgery in patients with unresectable stage III lung adenocarcinoma. METHODS: The authors investigated induction bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg) plus pemetrexed (500 mg/m(2) and carboplatin (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 5) followed by surgery for patients with unresectable stage III lung adenocarcinoma ages 18 to 65 years. The patients received neoadjuvant therapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. Surgery was scheduled 3 to 4 weeks after the last neoadjuvant therapy; then, the medical team assessed each patient's resectability status. The primary endpoint was the resectability rate. RESULTS: From April 2012 to April 2014, 42 patients were enrolled and received bevacizumab plus pemetrexed and carboplatin. Grade 3 or 4 induction-related AEs included fatigue in 5 patients, neutropenia in 4 patients, hypertension in 1 patient, anemia in 1 patient, and thrombocytopenia in 1 patient. One patient achieved a complete response, 22 achieved a partial response, 17 had stable disease, and 2 had progressive disease. After neoadjuvant therapy, 31 patients (73.8%) underwent surgery, including 11 who underwent pneumonectomy. Complete (R0) resection was achieved in 22 patients (52.4%). Reoperation was required in 1 patient because of a bleeding intercostal artery. No perioperative thromboembolic events or wound-healing problems were observed. The median event-free survival was 15.4 months, and the 1-year event-free survival rate was 56.1%. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with neoadjuvant bevacizumab in combination with pemetrexed and carboplatin followed by surgery appears to be feasible and safe in patients with unresectable stage III lung adenocarcinoma.

METHODS: The authors investigated induction bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg) plus pemetrexed (500 mg/m(2) and carboplatin (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 5) followed by surgery for patients with unresectable stage III lung adenocarcinoma ages 18 to 65 years. The patients received neoadjuvant therapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. Surgery was scheduled 3 to 4 weeks after the last neoadjuvant therapy; then, the medical team assessed each patient's resectability status. The primary endpoint was the resectability rate. RESULTS: From April 2012 to April 2014, 42 patients were enrolled and received bevacizumab plus pemetrexed and carboplatin. Grade 3 or 4 induction-related AEs included fatigue in 5 patients, neutropenia in 4 patients, hypertension in 1 patient, anemia in 1 patient, and thrombocytopenia in 1 patient. One patient achieved a complete response, 22 achieved a partial response, 17 had stable disease, and 2 had progressive disease. After neoadjuvant therapy, 31 patients (73.8%) underwent surgery, including 11 who underwent pneumonectomy. Complete (R0) resection was achieved in 22 patients (52.4%). Reoperation was required in 1 patient because of a bleeding intercostal artery. No perioperative thromboembolic events or wound-healing problems were observed. The median event-free survival was 15.4 months, and the 1-year event-free survival rate was 56.1%. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with neoadjuvant bevacizumab in combination with pemetrexed and carboplatin followed by surgery appears to be feasible and safe in patients with unresectable stage III lung adenocarcinoma.

The current retrospective analysis examined whether differences were present by histology in a three-arm trial of gemcitabine-carboplatin (GCb) or gemcitabine-paclitaxel (GP) versus a standard regimen of paclitaxel-carboplatin (PCb). MATERIALS AND METHODS: 1135 chemonaive patients with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC were randomly allocated to receive: gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) days 1 and 8 plus carboplatin area under the curve (AUC) 5.5 day 1 (GCb); or gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) days 1 and 8 plus paclitaxel 200mg/m(2) day 1 (GP); or paclitaxel 225 mg/m(2) plus carboplatin AUC 6.0 day 1 (PCb). Cycles were repeated every 21 days up to 6 cycles or disease progression. Clinical results were retrospectively analyzed in by patient histology. RESULTS: 202 patients (17.8%) had squamous, 555 (48.9%) had adenocarcinoma, 45 (4.0%) had large cell, and 333 (29.3%) had another histologic type. The overall response rate for squamous patients was greater than non-squamous (35.1% versus 27.8%, P=0.04). Median survival (9.5 months for squamous and 8.3 months for non-squamous) and median time to progression (5.0 months for squamous and 4.4 months for non-squamous) did not significantly vary by histologic group. For squamous histology, median survival was 6.6 months for GCb, 10.2 months for GP, and 10.3 months for PCb. For non-squamous disease, median survival was 8.2 months for GCb, 8.4 months for GP, and 8.3 months for PCb. A formal test for a histology-by-treatment interaction effect between GCb and PCb was significant (P=0.04). CONCLUSION: In this trial of commonly used agents for advanced NSCLC, overall survival and time to progression were similar when comparing patients across histologies. The effect of treatment, however, varied across histologies.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 28668866\nTitle: Histology-based Combination Induction Chemotherapy for Elderly Patients with Clinical Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.\nAuthors: Banna GL, Parra HJS, Castaing M\nJournal: Anticancer research\nPublication Date: 2017 Jul\nAbstract: AIM: To explore the feasibility and activity of a histology-based induction combination chemotherapy for elderly patients with clinical stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients aged >/=70 years with stage IIIA and IIIB lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or adenocarcinoma were treated with three cycles of carboplatin and gemcitabine or pemetrexed, respectively, followed by definitive radiotherapy or surgery. The primary endpoint was the overall response rate (ORR) following induction. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients, with a median age of 74 years (range=70-80 years) were treated for adenocarcinoma in 14 (52%) and SCC in 13 (48%), clinical stage IIIA in eight (30%) and IIIB in 19 (70%). Grade 3 or 4 toxicity was reported for five patients (18.5%). The ORR was 46% in 12 (partial responses) out of 26 assessable patients. CONCLUSION: Histology-based induction combination chemotherapy is active and feasible in elderly patients with stage III NSCLC.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
