The purpose of this study was to examine the correlation of tumor histology and clinical outcome of radiation therapy (RT) for stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to consider the necessity of adjuvant chemotherapy after RT for these patients. The subjects were 83 patients, 54 with SQ and 29 with AD; they had received definitive RT with the total dose ranging from 60 to 80 Gy with conventional fractionation at a daily dose of 2 Gy. The differences between SQ and AD with respect to survival and recurrence pattern were investigated. The 5-year overall survival and cause-specific survival rates were 26.5% and 49.1%, respectively. No difference in survival was observed between SQ and AD patients, and the recurrence rates were almost identical (44% for SQ and 45% for AD). However, the 5-year primary control rate of SQ was significantly poorer than that of AD (SQ: 61.5%; AD: 87.6%; p = 0.03). Conversely, the 5-year metastasis-free survival rate of SQ was significantly better than that of AD (SQ: 88.2%; AD: 53.0%; p = 0.005). The different failure pattern, according to tumor histology, indicates that taking into consideration the difference in their clinical behaviors would also be important for planning RT and surgery for early lung cancer.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 29290268\nTitle: Recurrence dynamics after trimodality therapy (Neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy and surgery) in patients with stage IIIA (N2) lung cancer.\nAuthors: Lee J, Kim HK, Park BJ\nJournal: Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)\nPublication Date: 2018 Jan\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION: We investigated the timing and patterns of recurrence after the treatment of stage IIIA (N2) non-small cell lung cancer via neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An institutional database was reviewed retrospectively between 1997 and 2013 (N=570). Eligible patients had pathologically proven N2 disease, and they completed the planned trimodality therapy with curative intent. The hazard rate function and competing risk analysis were used to evaluate the recurrence dynamics. RESULTS: Among the included patients, 76% had single station N2 involvement and 95% had complete resection. The 5-year overall and recurrence-free survival rates were 47% and 29%, respectively. Of the 290 patients who experienced recurrence, 25 (8.4%) experienced loco-regional recurrence, whereas 238 (80.4%) had distant metastases. The hazard rate function for overall recurrence revealed a peak at approximately 8 months after surgery and a marked decline after 2 years. The peak recurrence frequency of distant metastasis differed at each site, with isolated brain metastases exhibiting the earliest peak (6 months) and a narrow recurrence interval (15 months). A histological comparison revealed a higher recurrence hazard rate for adenocarcinoma than for squamous cell carcinoma but similar pattern of recurrences. Patients with complete responses had a lower cumulative incidence rate of recurrence but a slightly earlier peak of recurrence. Nodal responses to induction therapy demonstrated that patents with ypN0 had the lowest recurrence risk, whereas patients with ypN1 and ypN2 had similar hazard rates and cumulative incidence rates of recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: The dynamics of recurrence after trimodality therapy is organ-specific and varies according to pathologic factors. Our finding provides information on selection patients with risk of recurrence and timing of surveillance study.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 25958850\nTitle: A Retrospective Study of Stage I to IIIa Lung Adenocarcinoma After Resection: What Is the Optimal Adjuvant Modality for Patients With an EGFR Mutation?\nAuthors: Lv C, An C, Feng Q\nJournal: Clinical lung cancer\nPublication Date: 2015 Nov\nAbstract: We retrospectively reviewed a total of 257 stage I to IIIa lung adenocarcinoma after resection, tested them for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation, and analyzed the effect of perioperative treatment on survival. The results showed that in patients with an EGFR mutation, adjuvant EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor monotherapy after complete resection significantly prolongs disease-free survival compared with adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. BACKGROUND: Adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy improves non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 5-year survival rates after resection. However, adjuvant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) efficacy and the optimal adjuvant treatment are unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical records of patients tested for EGFR mutation after complete NSCLC resection were reviewed and tested for significance; EGFR mutation and adjuvant therapy effects on survival were assessed using univariate and Cox regression analyses. RESULTS: We enrolled 257 patients (stage I, 126; stage II-IIIa, 131); 138 had EGFR mutation. EGFR mutation status was unrelated to recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.572-1.204; P = .326) or death (HR, 0.679; 95% CI, 0.406-1.136; P = .14). Thirty-one patients with EGFR mutation received adjuvant EGFR-TKIs; most (87.1%) received EGFR-TKI monotherapy. Patients who received adjuvant EGFR-TKIs had longer disease-free survival (DFS) than those who did not (P = .033) or received conventional adjuvant chemotherapy (P = .038). Adjuvant EGFR-TKIs did not affect overall survival (OS; P = .258), although the recipients had better 3-year OS (92.5% vs. 81%). Eight patients who received adjuvant EGFR-TKI developed disease recurrence, which occurred in 7 patients during adjuvant treatment. In the adjuvant EGFR-TKI group patients with a primary tumor EGFR mutation, EGFR mutation in the corresponding metastatic lymph nodes did not affect DFS, but patients who received EGFR-TKI after recurrence had longer progression-free survival (P = .087). CONCLUSION: In patients with an EGFR mutation, adjuvant EGFR-TKI monotherapy after complete resection significantly prolongs DFS compared with adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

According to Article #2 from the PUBMED search results, the recurrence dynamics after trimodality therapy (neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy and surgery) in patients with stage IIIA (N2) lung cancer showed that the hazard rate function for overall recurrence revealed a peak at approximately 8 months after surgery and a marked decline after 2 years. \n\nGiven that the patient's latest CT scan at age 79.129 revealed no cancer progression, and considering the patient's age and treatment history, the risk of recurrence in the next 12 months might be lower compared to patients with progressive disease. However, it is essential to continue monitoring the patient for any signs of recurrence, especially given the nature of lung adenocarcinoma to recur.\n\nArticle #1 suggests that adenocarcinoma has a different failure pattern compared to squamous cell carcinoma, with a higher recurrence hazard rate but similar patterns of recurrences. This information, combined with the patient's specific diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma, indicates a need for vigilant follow-up.\n\nArticle #3 discusses the optimal adjuvant modality for patients with an EGFR mutation, which is not directly applicable to this patient's case without information on EGFR mutation status. However, it highlights the importance of targeted therapies in the management of lung adenocarcinoma.\n\nConsidering these factors and the patient's current status, I would estimate that the likelihood of cancer recurrence in the next 12 months is present but potentially lower due to the patient's recent treatment and stable disease status at the last assessment.\n\n[ANSWER: B]"

Approximately 10% of patients with NSCLC have a rapid and clinically effective response to EGFR-TKIs due to the presence of specific activating EGFR mutations within the tumour cells.[A7927] More specifically, deletions around the LREA motif in exon 19 and exon 21 L858R point mutations are correlated with response to therapy.[A7928]\r\n\r\nDevelopment of third-generation EGFR-TKIs, such as osimertinib, has been in response to altered tumour resistance patterns following treatment and toxic side effects that impact patient quality of life. Treatment with first-generation EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib and erlotinib) has been associated with the development of resistance through activating mutations in the EGFR gene. Second-generation EGFR-TKIs (afatinib and dacomitinib) were then developed to be more potent inhibitors, although their use is associated with increased toxicity through nonspecific targeting of wild-type EGFR. In contrast, third-generation inhibitors are specific for the gate-keeper T790M mutations which increases ATP binding activity to EGFR and result in poor prognosis for late-stage disease. Furthermore, osimertinib has been shown to spare wild-type EGFR during therapy, thereby reducing non-specific binding and limiting toxicity.[A7926,A7927,A7931]\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n",

This study investigated the clinical characteristics, survival and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene (EGFR) mutation status of lung adenocarcinoma patients with MPE. From June 2005 to December 2010, consecutive pleural effusions were collected prospectively. Patient clinical characteristics, EGFR mutation status, and overall survival were analysed. We collected MPEs from 448 patients in stage IV lung adenocarcinoma at initial diagnosis. Median overall survival for patients with MPEs at initial diagnosis and following disease progression were 14.3 months and 21.4 months, respectively (p=0.001). There were 296 (66.1%) patients harbouring EGFR mutations, the mutation rates among patients with an MPE at initial diagnosis and one following disease progression were 68.2% and 56.6%, respectively (p=0.044); the L858R mutation rate was also higher among the former (32.6% versus 18.1%; p=0.009). Multivariate analysis revealed that patients who: developed MPEs following disease progression, harboured EGFR mutations, and received EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, had longer overall survival. Patients in stage IV lung adenocarcinoma with MPEs at initial diagnosis have shorter overall survival and higher EGFR mutation rate, especially for L858R, than patients who develop MPEs following disease progression.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 33494181\nTitle: Immune Resistance in Lung Adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Spella M, Stathopoulos GT\nJournal: Cancers\nPublication Date: 2021 Jan 21\nAbstract: Lung cancer is the leading cancer killer worldwide, imposing grievous challenges for patients and clinicians. The incidence of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), the main histologic subtype of lung cancer, is still increasing in current-, ex-, and even non-smokers, whereas its five-year survival rate is approximately 15% as the vast majority of patients usually present with advanced disease at the time of diagnosis. The generation of novel drugs targeting key disease driver mutations has created optimism for the treatment of LUAD, but, as these mutations are not universal, this therapeutic line benefits only a subset of patients. More recently, the advent of targeted immunotherapies and their documented clinical efficacy in many different cancers, including LUAD, have started to change cancer management. Immunotherapies have been developed in order to overcome the cancer's ability to develop mechanisms of immune resistance, i.e., to adapt to and evade the host inflammatory and immune responses. Identifying a cancer's immune resistance mechanisms will likely advance the development of personalized immunotherapies. This review examines the key pathways of immune resistance at play in LUAD and explores therapeutic strategies which can unleash potent antitumor immune responses and significantly improve therapeutic efficacy, quality of life, and survival in LUAD.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 37284322\nTitle: Bevacizumab loaded CalliSpheres(R) bronchial arterial chemoembolization combined with immunotherapy and targeted therapy for advanced lung adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Liu H, Li Y, Li Z\nJournal: Frontiers in pharmacology\nPublication Date: 2023\nAbstract: Background: As a new drug delivery and embolization system, drug-eluted bronchial artery chemoembolization (DEB-BACE) can not only embolize the tumor blood supply artery but also load chemotherapy drugs and slowly release them into the local environment. Bevacizumab (BEV) combined with chemotherapy drugs has attained significant achievements in the first-line treatment of advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The role of BEV-loaded DEB-BACE combined with immunotherapy and targeted therapy in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is unclear. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab-loaded CalliSpheres(R) bronchial arterial chemoembolization combined with immunotherapy and targeted therapy in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Methods: Nine patients with LUAD who received BEV-loaded CalliSpheres(R) BACE combined with immunotherapy and targeted therapy from 1 Jan 2021 to Dec 2021 were included in this study. The primary endpoint was the disease control rate (DCR) and the objective response rate (ORR). The secondary endpoints were the overall survival rates (OS) at 6 months and 12 months. The tumor response was evaluated according to the mRECIST standard. Safety was assessed by the occurrences of adverse events and the severity of the adverse events. Results: All patients received CalliSpheres(R) BACE loaded with BEV (200 mg) in combination with immunotherapy and targeted therapy. A total of nine patients received the BACE procedures 20 times, four of them received a third session of BACE, three underwent a second session of DEB-BACE, and two underwent one cycle of DEB-BACE. Partial response and stable disease were found in seven (77.8%), and two (22.2%) patients, respectively, 1 month after the last multimodal treatment. The ORR at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months was 77.8%, 66.7%, 44.4%, and 33.3%, respectively, while the DCR was 100%, 77.8%, 44.4%, and 33.3%, respectively. The OS rates at 6-and 12-month were 77.8% and 66.7%, respectively. There were no serious adverse events. Conclusion: BEV-loaded CalliSpheres(R) transcatheter bronchial arterial chemoembolization combined with immunotherapy and targeted therapy is a promising and well-tolerated treatment for patients with lung adenocarcinoma.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
