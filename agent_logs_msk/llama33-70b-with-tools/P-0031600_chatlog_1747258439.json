Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nCapecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers. Capecitabine is a prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to fluorouracil (antimetabolite) in the tumor, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor tissue.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0031600-T01-IM6\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0031600\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Colorectal Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Rectum\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Rectal Adenocarcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT468\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 579, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 70.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"READ\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

BACKGROUND: Sufficient data for elderly rectal cancer patients who received definitive trimodality have not been accumulated yet. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 1232 rectal cancer patients who received neoadjuvant CRT and TME were enrolled in this study. After propensity-score matching, 310 younger patients and 310 elderly patients were matched with 1:1 manner. Treatment response, toxicity, surgical outcome, recurrence, and survival were assessed and compared between the 2 groups of patients. RESULTS: The median age was 58 years for the younger patient group and 74 years for the elderly group. Pathologic complete response rates were not significantly different between the 2 groups (younger and elderly: 17.1% vs 14.8%, P = 0.443). The 5-year recurrence-free survival (younger and elderly: 67.7% vs 65.5%, P = 0.483) and overall survival (younger and elderly: 82.9% vs. 79.5%, P = 0.271) rates were not significantly different between the 2 groups either. Adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery was less frequently delivered to the elderly than that to younger patients (83.9% vs 69.0%). Grade 3 or higher acute hematologic toxicity was observed more frequently in the elderly than that in the younger group (9.0% vs 16.1%, P = 0.008). Late complication rate was higher in the elderly group compared with that in the younger group without statistical significance (2.6% vs 4.5%, P = 0.193). CONCLUSIONS: Although acute hematologic toxicity was observed more frequently in the elderly patients than that in the younger patients, elderly rectal cancer patients with good performance status who received preoperative CRT and TME showed favorable tumor response and recurrence-free survival similar to younger patients.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 30565830\nTitle: The relationship between mesorectal grading and oncological outcome in rectal adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Silva-Velazco J, Stocchi L, Valente MA\nJournal: Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland\nPublication Date: 2019 Mar\nAbstract: AIM: The prognostic association between mesorectal grading and oncological outcome in patients undergoing resection for rectal adenocarcinoma is controversial. The aim of this retrospective chart review was to determine the individual impact of mesorectal grading on rectal cancer outcomes. METHOD: We compared oncological outcomes in patients with complete, near-complete and incomplete mesorectum who underwent rectal excision with curative intent from 2009 to 2014 for Stage cI-III rectal adenocarcinoma. We also assessed the independent association of mesorectal grading and oncological outcome using multivariate models including other relevant variables. RESULTS: Out of 505 patients (339 men, median age of 60 years), 347 (69%) underwent a restorative procedure. There were 452 (89.5%), 33 (6.5%) and 20 (4%) patients with a complete, near-complete and incomplete mesorectum, respectively. Local recurrence was seen in 2.4% (n = 12) patients after a mean follow-up of 3.1 +/- 1.7 years. Unadjusted 3-year Kaplan-Meier analysis by mesorectal grade showed decreased rates of overall, disease-free and cancer-specific survival and increased rates of overall and distant recurrence with a near-complete mesorectum, while local recurrence was increased in cases of an incomplete mesorectum (all P < 0.05). On multivariate analyses, a near-complete mesorectum was independently associated with decreased cancer-specific survival (hazard ratio 0.26, 95% CI 0.1-0.7; P = 0.007). There were no associations between mesorectal grading and overall survival, disease-free survival, overall recurrence or distant recurrence (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Mesorectal grading is independently associated with oncological outcome. It provides unique information for optimizing surgical quality in rectal cancer.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 39733405\nTitle: Pathologic Features of Rectal Adenocarcinoma after Preoperative Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation Therapy and the Prognostic Factors for Local Recurrence: A Retrospective Study at Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital.\nAuthors: Boonplod C, Kongkarnka S, Supatrakul E\nJournal: Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP\nPublication Date: 2024 Dec 1\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is a significant global health concern, with Thailand reporting notable incidence rates. Locally advanced rectal cancer demands effective treatment strategies to reduce the risk of local recurrence post-surgery; however, the predictive factors for local recurrence are uncertain.. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated patients with rectal adenocarcinoma undergoing preoperative concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT). The pathological findings and predictors of local recurrence in rectal adenocarcinoma were examined following preoperative CCRT. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in patients with rectal adenocarcinoma who underwent preoperative CCRT and surgery at the Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital from January 2018 to December 2022. Data were collected from patients to investigate the associations between pathological prognostic factors and local recurrence of rectal adenocarcinoma. For the analysis of continuous variables, the Student's t-test was employed to assess univariate associations. In the case of categorical variables, comparisons were made using the chi-square test and the Kruskal-Wallis test. Furthermore, the Kaplan-Meier method, supplemented by the log-rank test, was utilized to examine the relationships between baseline prognostic variables and disease-free survival endpoints. RESULTS: Of the 70 patients who received preoperative CCRT, 14 (20%) experienced recurrence. Univariate log-rank analysis identified five pathologic predictors of the disease-free survival of preoperative CCRT patients: ypT stage (p = 0.0030), lymphatic space invasion (p = 0.0033), venous invasion (p = 0.0345), circumferential resection margin (CRM) (p = 0.0003), and TNM staging (p = 0.0109). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, ypTNM stage and CRM status were independent predictors for disease progression of preoperative CCRT patients. CONCLUSION: ypTNM staging and CRM status emerged as independent predictors of local recurrence. The study also identified age and gender variations in rectal cancer incidence, highlighting the importance of tailored screening approaches.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Survival is still depending on factors related to the patient, the tumor or the surgeon. AIM: The aim of our study is to report survival and prognosis factors of our patients managed for a rectal cancer. METHODS:   We report an descreptive retrospective study about 154 patients. SPSS 19.0 version was used for the statistical analysis. Desriptive study was done using means, and pourcentage. Survival was analysed using Kaplan meier curve. In univariate analysis, we calculated the odd ratio in order to evaluate risk factors. Multivariate analysis used Cox model. Significancy was 0.05. RESULTS: Global survival was 52.4% at 3 years and 42.4% at 5 years. Free reccurence survival was 76%  at 3 years and 69.15% at 5 years. In univariate analysis, factors significantly influencing survival were age>70 years, CAE level, tumor perforation, TNM, tumor differentiation, peroperative blood transfusion, and reccurency. In multivriate analysis, only age > 70 years, T and local reccurency were independants factors influencing survival.

We used this information to establish a model that combined deep learning with a multilayer neural network (the DeepSurv model) for predicting the survival rate of patients with rectal adenocarcinoma. METHODS: We collected patients with rectal adenocarcinoma in the United States and older than 20 yearswho had been added to the SEER database from 2004 to 2015. We divided these patients into training and test cohortsat a ratio of 7:3. The training cohort was used to develop a seven-layer neural network based on the analysis method established by Katzman and colleagues to construct a DeepSurv prediction model. We then used the C-index and calibration plots to evaluate the prediction performance of the DeepSurv model. RESULTS: The 49,275 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma included in the study were randomly divided into the training cohort (70%, n = 34,492) and the test cohort (30%, n = 14,783). There were no statistically significant differences in clinical characteristics between the two cohorts (p > 0.05). We applied Cox proportional-hazards regression to the data in the training cohort, which showed that age, sex, marital status, tumor grade, surgery status, and chemotherapy status were significant factors influencing survival (p < 0.05). Using the training cohort to construct the DeepSurv model resulted in a C-index of the model of 0.824, while using the test cohort to verify the DeepSurv model yielded a C-index of 0.821. Thesevalues show that the prediction effect of the DeepSurv model for the test-cohort patients was highly consistent with the prediction resultsfor the training-cohort patients. CONCLUSION: The DeepSurv prediction model of the seven-layer neural network that we have established can accurately predict the survival rateand time of rectal adenocarcinoma patients.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 28742692\nTitle: Oncologic Outcome and Morbidity in the Elderly Rectal Cancer Patients After Preoperative Chemoradiotherapy and Total Mesorectal Excision: A Multi-institutional and Case-matched Control Study.\nAuthors: Sung SY, Jang HS, Kim SH\nJournal: Annals of surgery\nPublication Date: 2019 Jan\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE: To determine the toxicity and oncologic outcome of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by curative total mesorectal excision (TME) in the elderly (>/=70 yrs) and younger (<70 yrs) rectal cancer patients. BACKGROUND: Sufficient data for elderly rectal cancer patients who received definitive trimodality have not been accumulated yet. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 1232 rectal cancer patients who received neoadjuvant CRT and TME were enrolled in this study. After propensity-score matching, 310 younger patients and 310 elderly patients were matched with 1:1 manner. Treatment response, toxicity, surgical outcome, recurrence, and survival were assessed and compared between the 2 groups of patients. RESULTS: The median age was 58 years for the younger patient group and 74 years for the elderly group. Pathologic complete response rates were not significantly different between the 2 groups (younger and elderly: 17.1% vs 14.8%, P = 0.443). The 5-year recurrence-free survival (younger and elderly: 67.7% vs 65.5%, P = 0.483) and overall survival (younger and elderly: 82.9% vs. 79.5%, P = 0.271) rates were not significantly different between the 2 groups either.
