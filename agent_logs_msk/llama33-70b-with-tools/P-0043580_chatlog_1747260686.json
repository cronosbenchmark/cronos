Data are also lacking for KRAS submutations and prognosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined clinicopathological variables and prognosis in patients with surgically resected stage III CC who participated in seven clinical trials from the ACCENT/IDEA databases. Associations between KRAS exon 2 and BRAF(V600E) mutations and time to recurrence (TTR), overall survival (OS), and survival after recurrence (SAR) were assessed using a Cox model. We also analyzed the prognostic value of KRAS exon 2 submutations. RESULTS: Among 8460 patients, 11.4% had MSI-H status. In the MSI-H group, BRAF(V600E), KRAS exon 2 mutants, and double-wild-type statuses were detected in 40.6%, 18.1%, and 41.3%, respectively, whereas and in the microsatellite stable (MSS) group, these were detected in 7.7%, 38.6%, and 53.8%, respectively. In the MSS group, 5-year TTR rates of 61.8%, 66.3%, and 72.9% were observed among patients with BRAF(V600E), KRAS exon 2 mutants, and those who were DWT, respectively [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 1.58 and 1.31, both P < 0.001]. In the MSI-H group, 5-year TTR rates did not differ significantly among the mutated subgroups. Similar results were found for OS. However, survival after relapse was significantly shorter in the KRAS exon 2- and BRAF(V600E)-mutated patients in both MSS (adjusted HR = 2.06 and 1.15; both P < 0.05) and MSI-H (adjusted HR = 1.99 and 1.81; both P < 0.05) groups. In the MSS group, KRAS exon 2 mutations were associated with TTR, but only p.G12C, p.G12D, and p.G13D were associated with poor outcomes after disease recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Testing for both KRAS and BRAF(V600E) mutations in stage III patients should be considered as they can better define individual patient prognosis, and may also enable patient selection for (neo)adjuvant trials dedicated to specific molecular subtypes with poor prognosis.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 32897827\nTitle: Multicenter International Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer Study of the Consensus Immunoscore for the Prediction of Survival and Response to Chemotherapy in Stage III Colon Cancer.\nAuthors: Mlecnik B, Bifulco C, Bindea G\nJournal: Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology\nPublication Date: 2020 Nov 1\nAbstract: PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of Immunoscore in patients with stage III colon cancer (CC) and to analyze its association with the effect of chemotherapy on time to recurrence (TTR). METHODS: An international study led by the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer evaluated the predefined consensus Immunoscore in 763 patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control TNM stage III CC from cohort 1 (Canada/United States) and cohort 2 (Europe/Asia). CD3+ and cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocyte densities were quantified in the tumor and invasive margin by digital pathology. The primary end point was TTR. Secondary end points were overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), prognosis in microsatellite stable (MSS) status, and predictive value of efficacy of chemotherapy. RESULTS: Patients with a high Immunoscore presented with the lowest risk of recurrence, in both cohorts. Recurrence-free rates at 3 years were 56.9% (95% CI, 50.3% to 64.4%), 65.9% (95% CI, 60.8% to 71.4%), and 76.4% (95% CI, 69.3% to 84.3%) in patients with low, intermediate, and high immunoscores, respectively (hazard ratio [HR; high v low], 0.48; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.71; P = .0003). Patients with high Immunoscore showed significant association with prolonged TTR, OS, and DFS (all P < .001). In Cox multivariable analysis stratified by participating center, Immunoscore association with TTR was independent (HR [high v low], 0.41; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.67; P = .0003) of patient's sex, T stage, N stage, sidedness, and microsatellite instability status. Significant association of a high Immunoscore with prolonged TTR was also found among MSS patients (HR [high v low], 0.36; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.62; P = .0003). Immunoscore had the strongest contribution chi2 proportion for influencing survival (TTR and OS). Chemotherapy was significantly associated with survival in the high-Immunoscore group for both low-risk (HR [chemotherapy v no chemotherapy], 0.42; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.71; P = .0011) and high-risk (HR [chemotherapy v no chemotherapy], 0.5; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.77; P = .0015) patients, in contrast to the low-Immunoscore group (P > .12). CONCLUSION: This study shows that a high Immunoscore significantly associated with prolonged survival in stage III CC. Our findings suggest that patients with a high Immunoscore will benefit the most from chemotherapy in terms of recurrence risk.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 24249458\nTitle: Expression of apoptosis regulating proteins identifies stage II and III colon cancer patients with high risk of recurrence.\nAuthors: Belt EJ, Stockmann HB, Delis-van Diemen PM\nJournal: Journal of surgical oncology\nPublication Date: 2014 Mar\nAbstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Deregulation of apoptosis related genes may be associated with poor outcome in cancer. Aim of the present study was to investigate the prognostic role of expression levels of apoptosis related proteins in stage II and III colon cancer. METHODS: From tumor samples of 386 stage II and III colon cancer patients, DNA was isolated and tissue microarrays were constructed. Expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-X, BAX, XIAP, Fas, FasL and c-FLIP was evaluated and PCR-based microsatellite instability analysis was performed. RESULTS: High FasL expressing tumors were associated with high disease recurrence rates in stage II colon cancer patients overall, as was low Bcl-X expression in microsatellite stable stage II patients. In stage II patients, a multivariable model based on FasL and Bcl-XL expression revealed a significant association with disease free survival (DFS). In stage III colon cancer patients, low Bcl-2, low BAX and low Fas expression levels were associated with worse outcome. In these patients a multivariable model based on angioinvasion and Bcl-2, Fas and FasL expression was significantly associated with DFS. CONCLUSIONS: Stage II patients with low Bcl-X and high FasL protein expression levels and stage III patients with low Fas, high FasL and low Bcl-2 expression could be considered as high risk for disease recurrence.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Annual Meeting\nPublication Date: 2018 May 23\nAbstract: Patterns of response and progression to immunotherapy may differ from those observed with drugs such as chemotherapy and molecularly targeted agents. Specifically, some patients experience a response after progression that is retrospectively named pseudoprogression. This phenomenon of pseudoprogression, first reported in patients with melanoma who were treated with ipilimumab, has led to the development of immune-specific related response criteria, such as irRC (immune-related response criteria), irRECIST (immune-related RECIST), and iRECIST (immunotherapy RECIST) that allow continued treatment beyond progression. However, the rate of pseudoprogression has never exceeded 10% of patients across tumor types. Conversely, rapid progressions after immunotherapy, called hyperprogressions, were reported by three different teams in 9% to 29% of patients treated with immunotherapy. Because of the absence of control arms in these studies, it remains to be determined whether these rapid progressions reflect a detrimental effect of immunotherapy in these patients. Finally, preliminary data suggest that immunotherapy might also affect response to subsequent standard therapies. In total, given the rarity of pseudoprogressions across tumor types and the recent description of hyperprogressions, classic RECIST remains a reasonable and rational method to assess response to immunotherapy. Continuation of treatment beyond progression should be proposed only in carefully selected patients whose clinical conditions have improved and who have not experienced severe toxicities. Although there is an urgent need to identify predictive biomarkers of efficacy to immunotherapy, there is an equally urgent need to identify predictive factors of progression or possibly hyperprogression.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 33677699\nTitle: Chronic kidney disease progression in aged patients.\nAuthors: Tugcu M, Barutcu Atas D\nJournal: International urology and nephrology\nPublication Date: 2021 Dec\nAbstract: PURPOSE: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major morbidity, and its prevalence increases with age. However, there appears to be some confusion about the prognosis of CKD in aged patients, because, it has its own characteristics different from youngers. In this study, we investigated the progression of CKD and related factors in aged patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective study including 334 patients over 80 years of age that were diagnosed with stage 3-4 CKD at our CKD clinic. CKD progression was assessed as an annual decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Comorbidities were globally categorized with the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), but diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cardiac morbidities were evaluated separately. Patients were grouped as either 'progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD)' or 'others'. RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 191 (57.2%) patients exhibited progression; the annual median eGFR declined by 0.8 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Only 27 (8.1%) of these patients progressed to ESRD. In univariant and multivariate models, respectively, progressing to ESRD was significantly associated with cardiac comorbidities (p < 0.001, p < 0.001), proteinuria (p < 0.001, p = 0.03), and the baseline eGFR value (p < 0.001, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In aged patients, CKD progressed slowly, but particularly high initial creatinine levels and proteinuria could be indicator of progression. In addition, cardiac comorbidities may facilitate progression to ESRD.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 10459830\nTitle: Progression of cancer.\nAuthors: Hirata Y\nJournal: Medical hypotheses\nPublication Date: 1999 Jun\nAbstract: Carcinoma constitution originates in the hetero-duplication mitoses (4) which divide non-maturable stem cells into two different types of daughter cells: maturable and non-maturable cancerous stem cells. Throughout the progression of such mitoses, the organoid continuity of the cancer depends only on the non-maturable daughter stem cells, not on the maturable ones. This type of cancer can be considered non-progressive or to be in the incubation stage, as it only enables cancer tissue to preserve its organoid continuity without allowing progressive growth. However, when an occasional mitotic phase of the hetero-duplication mitotic progression undergoes genuine cell-phase duplication mitosis, this non-progressive or incubation stage of cancer is converted to a progressive type of cancer. This conversion is dependent on the reappearance of the complete mitotic condition of the mitotic maturation promoting system (MMPS) containing an abnormal supplement. Thus, a thorough investigation of the abnormal supplement and the reappearance of the complete mitotic condition is an essential part of research efforts to prevent and eradicate cancer.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

The influence of the depth of remission on the risk of progression has not been adequately evaluated. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study including surgically naive CD patients with inflammatory phenotype evaluated concomitantly by magnetic resonance enterography and colonoscopy. The degree of remission was correlated with the risk of progressing to stricturing and penetrating phenotypes. RESULTS: Three hundred nineteen CD patients were included: 27.0% with transmural remission, 16.0% with isolated endoscopic remission, 14.4% with isolated radiologic remission, and 42.6% without remission. Patients with transmural remission presented the lowest rates of phenotype progression (1.2%), with a significant difference compared to isolated radiologic remission (10.9%, p = 0.019), to isolated endoscopic remission (19.6%, p </= 0.001), and to no remission (46.3%, p </= 0.001). In multivariate regression analysis, transmural remission (OR 0.017 95% CI 0.002-0.135, p < 0.001), isolated radiologic remission (OR 0.139 95% CI 0.049-0.396, p < 0.001), and isolated endoscopic remission (OR 0.301 95% CI 0.123-0.736, p = 0.008) resulted in lower rates of phenotype progression compared to no remission. No patient with transmural or isolated radiologic remission progressed to penetrating phenotypes. CONCLUSION: The degree of bowel remission correlates with the risk of phenotype progression. Patients with transmural remission are at the lowest risk of progressing to stricturing and penetrating phenotypes.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

chemotherapeutic agent. It was originally investigated for its antiviral effects, but it is now used as an anticancer therapy for various cancers.[A233135] Gemcitabine is a cytidine analog with two fluorine atoms replacing the hydroxyl on the ribose.[A233145] As a prodrug, gemcitabine is transformed into its active metabolites that work by replacing the building blocks of nucleic acids during DNA elongation, arresting tumour growth and promoting apoptosis of malignant cells.[L32960] The structure, metabolism, and mechanism of action of gemcitabine are similar to [cytarabine], but gemcitabine has a wider spectrum of antitumour activity.[A233140]\r\n\r\nGemcitabine is marketed as Gemzar and it is available as intravenous injection. It is approved by the FDA to treat advanced ovarian cancer in combination with [carboplatin], metastatic breast cancer in combination with [paclitaxel], non-small cell lung cancer in combination with [cisplatin], and pancreatic cancer as monotherapy.[L32950] It is also being investigated in other cancer and tumour types.\nOxaliplatin: Oxaliplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nPaclitaxel: Paclitaxel is a chemotherapeutic agent marketed under the brand name Taxol among others. Used as a treatment for various cancers, paclitaxel is a mitotic inhibitor that was first isolated in 1971 from the bark of the Pacific yew tree which contains endophytic fungi that synthesize paclitaxel. It is available as an intravenous solution for injection and the newer formulation contains albumin-bound paclitaxel marketed under the brand name Abraxane.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"
