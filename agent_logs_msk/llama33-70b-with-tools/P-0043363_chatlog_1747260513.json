MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 1258 lung adenocarcinoma patients who underwent curative resections between 2006 and 2017. We analyzed overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS) across tumor grades and lymphadenectomy extent, categorized as IASLC-R0 (complete resection) or R(un) (uncertain resection). RESULTS: The median age of cohort was 63 and 41.9 % were male. The majority had undergone lobectomy. The distribution of tumors was 274 grade 1, 558 grade 2, and 426 grade 3 cases. After a median follow-up time of 102 months, the 10-year OS/CSS/RFS rates worsened significantly across grade 1-3: 92.4/99.3/92.3 %, 77.8/87.5/71.7 %, and 63.6/70.2/52.0 %, respectively (p < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified grade 3, R(un) lymphadenectomy, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index, smoking history, thoracotomy, higher pathology stage, and angiolymphatic invasion as independent prognostic factors for lower OS, CSS, and RFS. Furthermore, grade 3 patients benefited significantly from IASLC-R0 lymphadenectomy, showing significantly better OS and RFS than those who underwent R(un) lymphadenectomy (p = 0.007 for OS, p = 0.001 for RFS, post-propensity score matching). Among grade 3 tumors underwent R0 or R(un) resections found the incidence rates of local, distant, and simultaneous local and distant recurrence were 8.5 % vs 13.7 %, 11.0 % vs 12.2 %, and 11.0 % vs 20.6 %, respectively. CONCLUSION: Surgical outcomes for lung adenocarcinoma have declined across grades 1-3. IASLC-R(un) treatment worsens OS and RFS in grade 3. Intensive monitoring and adjuvant therapy should be considered when patients with grade 3 lung adenocarcinoma undergo R(un) lymphadenectomy.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 29058973\nTitle: Post-recurrence survival analysis of stage I non-small-cell lung cancer.\nAuthors: Lee K, Kim HR, Kim DK\nJournal: Asian cardiovascular & thoracic annals\nPublication Date: 2017 Nov\nAbstract: Background The aim of this retrospective study was to review recurrence patterns of stage I non-small-cell lung cancer and identify prognostic factors for post-recurrence survival. Methods Among 940 patients with pathological stage I non-small-cell lung cancer who underwent curative resection, 261 experienced a recurrence; of these, 188 had adenocarcinoma and 62 had squamous cell carcinoma. Oligo-recurrence was defined as 1-3 recurrent lesions restricted to a single organ. Potentially curative local treatment included surgery, stereotactic radiotherapy, and photodynamic therapy. Results The median follow-up duration was 65 months (range 4-186 months). The most common site of recurrence was the lung in 145 patients, followed by mediastinal lymph nodes in 49, pleura in 30, and brain in 27. Local treatment for recurrent tumors included surgery in 59 patients, stereotactic radiotherapy in 46, photodynamic therapy in 2, and other radiotherapy in 41. Seventy-eight patients received chemotherapy only, and 35 received conservative treatment. Among 125 patients who were evaluated for an epidermal growth factor receptor gene mutation, 31 were treated with epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The 3- and 5-year post-recurrence survival rates were 49.1% and 33.8%, respectively. Age at recurrence, adenocarcinoma cell type, disease-free interval, epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment, and potentially curative local treatment were independent prognostic factors for survival in multivariate analysis. Conclusions Local treatment for recurrence should be considered in selected candidates, and use of epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor I is reasonable if an epidermal growth factor receptor mutation is detected.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 17549572\nTitle: Surgical management and outcome in primary adenocarcinoma of the small bowel.\nAuthors: Agrawal S, McCarron EC, Gibbs JF\nJournal: Annals of surgical oncology\nPublication Date: 2007 Aug\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Primary adenocarcinoma of the small bowel is a rare malignancy and is associated with poor survival outcome. Patient, tumor and treatment-related factors were analyzed for their association with recurrence and survival. METHODS: Between 1971 and 2005, 64 patients with primary adenocarcinoma of the small bowel were treated at our institution. Clinico-pathologic data, operative details, postoperative treatment, recurrence pattern and survival were reviewed. RESULTS: The most common clinical features at presentation included abdominal pain (n = 33; 51.6%) or bowel obstruction (n = 20; 31.3%). The most frequently involved portion of the small bowel was the duodenum (n = 41; 64%). A segmental bowel resection was performed in 30 patients and pancreaticoduodenectomy in 14 patients. Postoperative mortality and morbidity rates were 3.6% (n = 2) and 14.5% (n = 8), respectively. Of the 55 patients who underwent operative intervention, a curative resection was performed in 30 (54.5%). The most common sites of recurrence following a curative resection were the liver and lung. Median survival for all 64 patients was 18 months with a 5-year survival of 21.1%. On multivariate analysis, absence of distant metastatic disease (5-year survival 30.4%), curative resection (5-year survival 44.8%) and pathological T stage 1-3 (5-year survival 39.2%) were identified as independent predictors of survival. CONCLUSIONS: A curative resection in the absence of both distant metastases and pathological T4 tumor provides the best survival outcome. Recurrence at distant sites is the predominant pattern of failure following a curative resection, suggesting a role for adjuvant therapy.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 1258 lung adenocarcinoma patients who underwent curative resections between 2006 and 2017. We analyzed overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS) across tumor grades and lymphadenectomy extent, categorized as IASLC-R0 (complete resection) or R(un) (uncertain resection). RESULTS: The median age of cohort was 63 and 41.9 % were male. The majority had undergone lobectomy. The distribution of tumors was 274 grade 1, 558 grade 2, and 426 grade 3 cases. After a median follow-up time of 102 months, the 10-year OS/CSS/RFS rates worsened significantly across grade 1-3: 92.4/99.3/92.3 %, 77.8/87.5/71.7 %, and 63.6/70.2/52.0 %, respectively (p < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified grade 3, R(un) lymphadenectomy, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index, smoking history, thoracotomy, higher pathology stage, and angiolymphatic invasion as independent prognostic factors for lower OS, CSS, and RFS. Furthermore, grade 3 patients benefited significantly from IASLC-R0 lymphadenectomy, showing significantly better OS and RFS than those who underwent R(un) lymphadenectomy (p = 0.007 for OS, p = 0.001 for RFS, post-propensity score matching). Among grade 3 tumors underwent R0 or R(un) resections found the incidence rates of local, distant, and simultaneous local and distant recurrence were 8.5 % vs 13.7 %, 11.0 % vs 12.2 %, and 11.0 % vs 20.6 %, respectively. CONCLUSION: Surgical outcomes for lung adenocarcinoma have declined across grades 1-3. IASLC-R(un) treatment worsens OS and RFS in grade 3. Intensive monitoring and adjuvant therapy should be considered when patients with grade 3 lung adenocarcinoma undergo R(un) lymphadenectomy.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 36646211\nTitle: RET-MAP: An International Multicenter Study on Clinicobiologic Features and Treatment Response in Patients With Lung Cancer Harboring a RET Fusion.\nAuthors: Aldea M, Marinello A, Duruisseaux M\nJournal: Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer\nPublication Date: 2023 May\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION: Nearly 1% to 2% of NSCLCs harbor RET fusions. Characterization of this rare population is still incomplete. METHODS: This retrospective multicenter study included patients with any-stage RET positive (RET+) NSCLC from 31 cancer centers. Molecular profiling included DNA/RNA sequencing or fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses. Clinicobiological features and treatment outcomes (per investigator) with surgery, chemotherapy (CT), immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs), CT-ICB, multityrosine kinase inhibitors, and RET inhibitors (RETis) were evaluated. RESULTS: For 218 patients included between February 2012 and April 2022, median age was 63 years, 56% were females, 93% had adenocarcinoma, and 41% were smokers. The most frequent fusion partner was KIF5B (72%). Median tumor mutational burden was 2.5 (range: 1-4) mutations per megabase, and median programmed death-ligand 1 expression was 10% (range: 0%-55%). The most common metastatic sites were the lung (50%), bone (43%), and pleura (40%). Central nervous system metastases were found at diagnosis of advanced NSCLC in 21% of the patients and at last follow-up or death in 31%. Overall response rate and median progression-free survival were 55% and 8.7 months with platinum doublet, 26% and 3.6 months with single-agent CT, 46% and 9.6 months with CT-ICB, 23% and 3.1 months with ICB, 37% and 3 months with multityrosine kinase inhibitor, and 76% and 16.2 months with RETi, respectively. Median overall survival was longer in patients treated with RETi versus no RETi (50.6 mo [37.7-72.1] versus 16.3 mo [12.7-28.8], p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with RET+ NSCLC have mainly thoracic and bone disease and low tumor mutational burden and programmed death-ligand 1 expression. RETi markedly improved survival, whereas ICB may be active in selected patients.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 26022944\nTitle: Comparisons of the clinicopathological features and survival outcomes between lung cancer patients with adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.\nAuthors: Fukui T, Taniguchi T, Kawaguchi K\nJournal: General thoracic and cardiovascular surgery\nPublication Date: 2015 Sep\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE: Patients with lung cancer should be treated according to histological subtype because of the disparities in tumor aggressiveness and treatment responses. It is important to re-evaluate the clinicopathological features of the two major subtypes of lung cancer, adenocarcinoma (AD) and squamous cell carcinoma (SQ). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data on the clinicopathological features and outcomes of 2059 patients with pulmonary AD and pulmonary SQ who had undergone complete resection at Nagoya University Hospital and Aichi Cancer Center between 1995 and 2012. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 1587 patients with AD (77 %) and 472 with SQ (23 %). Female gender, no history of smoking, and small tumor size were distinct characteristics of AD patients, and a higher age was a characteristic of SQ patients (p < 0.0001). A significant difference was observed in overall survival, with 5-year survival rates of 78 % in AD patients and 63 % in SQ patients. Patients with stage IA and IB SQ had significantly worse outcomes than patients with AD at the same stage (p < 0.0001). Because no survival difference was observed between SQ patients with stage IA, IB, and IIA tumors (p = 0.75), these patients were considered to have proposed stage IIA disease. Then, comparable survival curves were obtained between stages II and IIIA SQ and AD. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with stage I SQ had significantly worse outcomes than patients with stage I AD. A newly defined stage grouping for SQ patients provided outcomes comparable to those of AD patients.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
