Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nCapecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers. Capecitabine is a prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to fluorouracil (antimetabolite) in the tumor, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor tissue.\nTrametinib: Trametinib is an orally bioavailable mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2 inhibitor.[A258298,A258293] It was first approved by the FDA in May 2013 for the treatment of melanoma.[A258298] It was later approved by Health Canada on July 18, 2013 [L45588] and by the European Commission on June 30, 2014.[L45583] Trametinib is currently approved to treat a variety of cancers with BRAF mutations, such as non-small cell lung cancer and thyroid cancer, as monotherapy or in combination with [dabrafenib], a BRAF inhibitor, for improved therapeutic efficacy. Originally developed by Japan Tobacco, trametinib was initially investigated for treating inflammation, but further studies for this indication were not pursued.[A258298]\nDabrafenib: Dabrafenib mesylate (Tafinlar) is a reversible ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor and targets the MAPK pathway. It was approved on May 29, 2013, for the treatment of melanoma with V600E or V6000K mutation.[L41955] It was also used for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with the same mutation.[L41955]\r\n\r\nIn May 2018, Tafinlar (dabrafenib), in combination with Mekinist ([DB08911]), was approved to treat anaplastic thyroid cancer caused by an abnormal BRAF V600E gene.[L41955]\nNivolumab: Nivolumab is a fully human IgG4 antibody targeting the immune checkpoint programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1).[L12129] This antibody was produced entirely in mice and grafted onto human kappa and IgG4 Fc region with the mutation _S228P_ for additional stability and reduced variability.[A35203] It was developed by Bristol Myers Squibb.[L12129]\r\n\r\nNivolumab was granted FDA approval on 22 December 2014.[L12129] It is also available in combination with [relatlimab] under the brand name Opdualag.[L41265,L49996,L50001]\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0042652-T02-IM7\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0042652\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Colorectal Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Colon\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Colon Adenocarcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT505\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 548, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 30.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"COAD\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

This article reports results from the authors' institution for patients in whom complete mesocolic excision was performed long before the term was coined. METHODS: Patients operated on for cure for primary adenocarcinoma of the colon between January 1994 and December 2004 were identified from a prospectively maintained, institutional review board-approved, colorectal cancer registry. Medical records and operation notes were reviewed. The primary outcomes were recurrence (local and distal) and age-adjusted 5-year survival. RESULTS: Some 1013 patients (560 men and 453 women) were identified, with a median age of 69 (range 21-96) years. The most common location of the cancer was the sigmoid colon (32.9 per cent), followed by the caecum (26.7 per cent) and ascending colon (17.0 per cent). Operations were performed laparoscopically in 134 patients (13.2 per cent). Median duration of hospital stay was 7 (range 1-64, mean 8.2) days. Overall morbidity and mortality rates were 13.5 and 2.2 per cent respectively; there were 20 anastomotic leaks (2.0 per cent). Some 282 patients (27.8 per cent) had stage I, 386 (38.1 per cent) stage II and 345 (34.1 per cent) stage III disease. Median lymph node yield was 28.3 (range 0-241, mean 28.3), and 12 or more nodes were examined in 88.1 per cent of patients. Adjuvant chemotherapy was administered to 277 patients (80.3 per cent) with stage III disease. Overall local and distant recurrence rates at 5 years were 5.1 and 17.1 per cent respectively. The 5-year local recurrence rate was 2.2, 5.3 and 7.7 per cent for American Joint Committee on Cancer stages I, II and III respectively. Corresponding distant recurrence rates were 4.0, 14.7 and 30.5 per cent. The 5-year overall cancer-free age-standardized survival rate was 85.3 per cent. Five-year age standardized survival rates for patients with disease stages I, II and III were 97.7, 90.8 and 69.8 per cent respectively. CONCLUSION: These data define modern results of surgery for colonic cancer with conservative use of chemotherapy.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 12113543\nTitle: Locoregional recurrence and survival after curative resection of adenocarcinoma of the colon.\nAuthors: Read TE, Mutch MG, Chang BW\nJournal: Journal of the American College of Surgeons\nPublication Date: 2002 Jul\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: There is wide variability in reported locoregional recurrence rates after curative resection of adenocarcinoma of the intraperitoneal colon, and there is no universally accepted surgical technique regarding length of the resected specimen or extent of lymphadenectomy. The aim of this study was to determine the disease-free survival, locoregional failure, and perioperative morbidity of patients undergoing curative resection of colon adenocarcinoma. STUDY DESIGN: The records of 316 consecutive patients undergoing curative resection for primary adenocarcinoma of the intraperitoneal colon between 1990 and 1995 were reviewed. Locoregional recurrence was defined as disease at the anastomosis or in the adjacent mesentery, peritoneum, retroperitoneum, or carcinomatosis. The product-limit method (Kaplan-Meier) was used to analyze survival and tumor recurrence. RESULTS: The study population comprised 167 men and 149 women, mean age 70+/-12 years (range 22 to 95 years). Median followup was 63+/-25 months. Five-year disease-free survival was 84% overall. Disease-free survival paralleled tumor stage: stage I, 99% (n = 73); stage II, 87% (n = 151); stage III, 72% (n = 92). The predominant pattern of tumor recurrence was distant failure only. Overall locoregional recurrence (locoregional and locoregional plus distant) at 5 years was 4%. Locoregional recurrence paralleled tumor stage: stage I, 0%; stage II, 2%; stage III, 10%. Of the 12 patients who suffered locoregional recurrence, 9 (75%) had T4 primary tumors, N2 nodal disease, or both. Major and minor complications occurred in 93 patients (29%) including: anastomotic leak or intraabdominal abscess (n = 4, 1%); hemorrhage (n = 8, 3%); cardiac complications (n= 17, 5%); pulmonary embolism (n=4, 10%); death (n=2, 1%). Multivariate analysis (Cox proportional hazards) revealed that the only independent predictor of disease-free survival and locoregional control was tumor stage. CONCLUSION: Longterm survival and locoregional control can be achieved for patients with colon cancer, with low morbidity. In the absence of adjacent organ invasion and N2 nodal disease, locoregional recurrence should be a rare event. Just as for rectal cancer, the technical aspects of colectomy for colon cancer deserve renewed attention.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 15789256\nTitle: Laparoscopic colectomy for colon adenocarcinoma: an 11-year retrospective review with 5-year survival rates.\nAuthors: Jacob BP, Salky B\nJournal: Surgical endoscopy\nPublication Date: 2005 May\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic colectomy for the management of colon cancer remains a controversial therapeutic option, especially when the outcomes are compared with the historically accepted survival data and recurrence rates after open surgery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the 5-year overall and disease-free survival rates after laparoscopic colon resection for invasive colon adenocarcinoma. METHODS: A total of 129 patients underwent consecutive laparoscopic colectomies for colon adenocarcinoma (between April 1992 and 2004 January) by a single surgeon at a single institution. Records were analyzed retrospectively and follow-up data was obtained. The Student t-test, Cox regression analysis, and Kaplan-Meier survival data were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: After patients with noninvasive disease on final pathology were excluded, the study population comprised 88 patients who underwent laparoscopic colectomies for invasive colon cancer with > 2 years of follow-up. Of these cases, 81 (93%) were amenable for complete follow-up at 11years (41 women and 40 men; mean age, 76 years). Mean follow-up was 61 months. There was one perioperative death (1.2%), and the overall postoperative morbidity rate was 13.6%. The average number of lymph nodes harvested was 10.1 (+/-6). There were no port site recurrences. The Kaplan-Meier survival data were as follows for 5-year overall survival and 5-year disease-free survival, respectively stage I (n = 34) 89% and 89%; stage II (n = 22), 65% and 59%; stage III (n = 19), 72% and 67%; stages I-III combined, (n = 75), 77% and 73%. CONCLUSIONS: For this specific cohort of patients undergoing curative laparoscopic colectomies for invasive colon adenocarcinoma, the mean follow-up was > 5 years. Overall survival and disease-free survival for stage I, II, and III colon cancer as well as for stages I-III combined are favorable and comparable to historically acceptable open colectomy survival rates. Overall survival and disease-free survival after laparoscopic colectomy for invasive colon cancer is no worse, and perhaps better than, the previously reported rates for the same procedure done by an open technique.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether there is a difference between tumour characteristics, treatment choices, and outcomes between the younger and older adults. METHOD: The patients who were diagnosed with colorectal carcinoma in our centre between 2010 and 2015 included. Clinicopathological features of tumour, treatment choices and survivals of the patients were recorded. Patients were separated into two groups according to their chronological age. RESULTS: The present study included 465 patients, there were 173 patients aged 65 years and older. Clinicopathological features were similar in both groups. Adjuvant chemotherapy was given in similar rates. Whereas combination chemotherapies were preferred in younger patients as first-line therapy, single agents were given to the older group(p-value < 0.001). No significant differences were observed between combination therapy and monotherapy as progression-free and overall survival in older adults(p value > 0.05). It was observed that 53.2% of the older patients was not treated with any biological treatment (p-value < 0.001). DISCUSSION: Geriatric people are underrepresented in clinical trials,because of the presence of the limitations in the older patients. The results of our study revealed older patients with colon cancer patients underwent surgery less than the younger ones, they recieved monotherapy more frequently as first-line chemotherapy, and less frequently targeted therapy. Their mortality was higher. It was shown that decision-making of colon cancer therapy is influenced by age according to our results.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 39480970\nTitle: Microbiological aspects of cancer progression: A systematic review conducted according to the PRISMA 2020 guidelines and the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.\nAuthors: Minervini G, Shivakumar S, Ronsivalle V\nJournal: Dental and medical problems\nPublication Date: 2024 Sep-Oct\nAbstract: The complex interplay between the gut microbiota, cancer treatments and patient characteristics has emerged as a significant area of research. This study sought to examine these relationships in the context of colorectal cancer (CRC).A comprehensive search of relevant studies was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines and the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. The studies included a variety of treatment modalities and microbiological parameters. A data extraction form, designed specifically for this review, was used to assess a range of variables across all studies.The analysis revealed a multifaceted interaction between the gut microbiota, genetic factors and treatment outcomes. Elderly patients with CRC frequently received single-agent chemotherapy, with outcomes that were comparable to those of younger patients. The presence of tumorigenic bacteria, including Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis, was associated with early colon neoplasia. Additionally, an abundance of Fusobacterium spp. was observed in colonic adenomas, contributing to a pro-inflammatory environment. Although the FcgammaRIIIa-158 V/V genotype was associated with higher cetuximab-mediated antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), no direct influence of FcgammaR polymorphisms on treatment response was noted. Furthermore, the combination of programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), BRAF and MEK inhibition showed favorable response rates. The gut microbiome, especially the presence of Fusobacterium spp., had a notable influence on the therapeutic response in CRC.These findings underscore the role of the gut microbiota and genetic factors in cancer treatment outcomes, emphasizing the potential of a holistic approach to cancer management. Future research should exploit these findings in order to develop microbiota-modulating strategies and personalized medicine approaches for the purpose of improving the efficacy of cancer treatment.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 37270504\nTitle: Young adults with colon cancer: clinical features and surgical outcomes.\nAuthors: Wang C, Gan L, Gao Z\nJournal: BMC gastroenterology\nPublication Date: 2023 Jun 3\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: The clinicopathological features, surgical outcomes, and long-term survival of patients with young-onset colon cancer (</= 40 years old) remain controversial. METHODS: The clinicopathologic and follow-up data of patients aged < 40 years with colon cancer between January 2014 and January 2022 were reviewed. The primary objectives were clinical features and surgical outcomes. Long-term survival was investigated as a secondary objective. RESULTS: Seventy patients were included in the study, and no significant rising trend (Z=0, P=1) of these patients was observed over the 8-year study period. Stage IV disease was accompanied by more ulcerative or infiltrating type (84.2% vs. 52.9%, P=0.017) and lymphovascular or perineural invasion (64.7% vs. 25.5%, P=0.003) than stage I-III disease. After a median follow-up time of 41 months (range 8-99 months), the 1-, 3-, and 5-year estimated overall survival (OS) rates were 92.6%, 79.5%, and 76.4%, respectively. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 79.6%, 71.7%, and 71.7%, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression showed that M+ stage (hazard ratio [HR], 3.942; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.176-13.220, P=0.026) was the only independent risk factor affecting OS. Meanwhile, tumor deposits (HR, 4.807; 95% CI, 1.942-15.488, P=0.009), poor differentiation (HR, 2.925; 95% CI, 1.012-8.454, P=0.047), and M+ stage (HR, 3.540; 95% CI, 1.118-11.202, P=0.032) independently affected PFS. CONCLUSIONS: The differences in the clinical features, surgical outcomes, and long-term survival between young adults and elderly colon cancer patients need further investigation.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

In 27 patients, the recurrence was diagnosed based upon persistent signs and symptoms or if the tumor was clinically palpable. In 15 patients, complete resection of the recurrent tumor was feasible, and the median survival time was 59 months, with a five year survival rate of 49 per cent.

The aim of this study was to determine the disease-free survival, locoregional failure, and perioperative morbidity of patients undergoing curative resection of colon adenocarcinoma. STUDY DESIGN: The records of 316 consecutive patients undergoing curative resection for primary adenocarcinoma of the intraperitoneal colon between 1990 and 1995 were reviewed. Locoregional recurrence was defined as disease at the anastomosis or in the adjacent mesentery, peritoneum, retroperitoneum, or carcinomatosis. The product-limit method (Kaplan-Meier) was used to analyze survival and tumor recurrence. RESULTS: The study population comprised 167 men and 149 women, mean age 70+/-12 years (range 22 to 95 years). Median followup was 63+/-25 months. Five-year disease-free survival was 84% overall. Disease-free survival paralleled tumor stage: stage I, 99% (n = 73); stage II, 87% (n = 151); stage III, 72% (n = 92). The predominant pattern of tumor recurrence was distant failure only. Overall locoregional recurrence (locoregional and locoregional plus distant) at 5 years was 4%. Locoregional recurrence paralleled tumor stage: stage I, 0%; stage II, 2%; stage III, 10%. Of the 12 patients who suffered locoregional recurrence, 9 (75%) had T4 primary tumors, N2 nodal disease, or both. Major and minor complications occurred in 93 patients (29%) including: anastomotic leak or intraabdominal abscess (n = 4, 1%); hemorrhage (n = 8, 3%); cardiac complications (n= 17, 5%); pulmonary embolism (n=4, 10%); death (n=2, 1%). Multivariate analysis (Cox proportional hazards) revealed that the only independent predictor of disease-free survival and locoregional control was tumor stage. CONCLUSION: Longterm survival and locoregional control can be achieved for patients with colon cancer, with low morbidity. In the absence of adjacent organ invasion and N2 nodal disease, locoregional recurrence should be a rare event. Just as for rectal cancer, the technical aspects of colectomy for colon cancer deserve renewed attention.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 32102382\nTitle: Comparison of a Five-Year Survival and Cancer Recurrence between Laparoscopically Assisted and Open Colonic Resections due to Adenocarcinoma-a Single Centre Experience.\nAuthors: Janez J, Skapin AD\nJournal: Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)\nPublication Date: 2020 Feb 24\nAbstract: Background and objectives: When resecting colon adenocarcinoma, surgeons decide between the use of laparoscopically assisted and open surgery. Laparoscopic resection is known to have short-term benefits over an open operation. However, researchers are not as unified about the long-term findings. The aim of this research is to elaborate on five-year post-operative differences in survival and cancer recurrence between these two different approaches. Materials and methods: 74 enrolled patients were evaluated five years after a primary operation. We collected dates of deaths of deceased patients and time after operation of possible recurrences. Carcinoma staging was done by a pathologist after operation. Blood samples were taken before surgery in order to measure tumor markers (CA19-9 and CEA). Results: Survival after colonic adenocarcinoma surgery did not differ between the two different surgical approaches (p = 0.151). Recurrence of cancer was not associated with the type of operation (p = 0.532). Patients with recurrence had a 37.6 times greater hazard ratio of dying (95% CI: [12.0, 118]; p < 0.001). Advanced age adversely affected survival: patients aged <65 and 65 years had a 97%, and 57% survival rate, respectively. Patients with elevated tumor markers at operation had a 19.1 greater hazard ratio of dying (95% CI: [5.16, 70.4]; p<0.001). Patients with different TNM stages did not have any statistically significant differences in survival (HR(II) = 2.49; 95% CI: [0.67, 9.30]; p(II) = 0.173) (HR(III) = 2.18; 95% CI: [0.58, 8.12]; p(III) = 0.246) or recurrence (p = 0.097). Conclusion: The obtained results suggest that laparoscopic resection of colon cancer is not inferior from an oncologic point of view and results in a similar long-term survival and disease-free interval. Recurrence of carcinoma, older age at initial operation and elevated tumor markers, above a pre-set threshold at operation, were found to be independent factors of lower survival. We believe that the obtained results will be of benefit when choosing treatment for colon adenocarcinoma.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
