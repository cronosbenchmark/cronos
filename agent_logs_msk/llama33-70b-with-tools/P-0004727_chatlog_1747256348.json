chemotherapy drug in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

        "content": "Based on the provided timeline and patient history, it appears that the patient has undergone various treatments, including chemotherapy with agents such as oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan, as well as radiation therapy. The patient's cancer presence and progression have been regularly monitored through CT scans, with results indicating that the cancer has not progressed at several points.\n\nThe patient's CA 19-9 lab test results have fluctuated, with values initially high (1043 Units/ml at age 60.482) and then decreasing over time (e.g., 629 Units/ml at age 60.614, 566 Units/ml at age 60.652, and eventually down to 56 Units/ml at age 61.687). These changes could indicate a response to treatment, though the exact clinical implications would depend on various factors including the specific context of the patient's disease and treatment protocol.\n\nGiven the information about the patient's treatment regimen, including the use of oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan, which are commonly used in colorectal cancer but also have applications in other cancers, it's reasonable to consider that the patient's treatment plan is aggressive and multifaceted, aiming to control the pancreatic adenocarcinoma.\n\nThe fact that CT scans have revealed no progression of the cancer at multiple time points suggests a level of control over the disease. However, the presence of cancer as indicated by positive HAS_CANCER findings at several ages (e.g., 60.482, 60.786, 61.192, 61.496, 61.602, and 61.668) with varying locations (including PELVIS and CHEST) indicates that the disease is ongoing and requires continued monitoring and treatment.\n\nTo assess the likelihood of cancer recurrence within the next 24 months, it's essential to consider the patient's current disease status, treatment response, and the natural history of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is known for its aggressive nature and high recurrence rate, even after seemingly effective treatment.\n\nConsidering the patient's age (61.7 years), the disease's history, and the treatments applied, without a current, comprehensive assessment of the patient's condition (e.g., latest imaging, lab tests, and clinical evaluation), it's challenging to predict with certainty the likelihood of recurrence. However, given the aggressive nature of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and the fact that the patient has had evidence of active cancer during the monitored period, there is a basis for concern regarding potential recurrence.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information and the natural history of the disease, the answer to whether the cancer will have a recurrence in the next 24 months would lean towards a cautious affirmative, acknowledging the aggressive nature of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and the importance of continued vigilant monitoring and treatment.\n\n[ANSWER: A]"

family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n",

Because of the special anatomic features of pancreatic neck, the selection of optimal surgical procedure for treatment of adenocarcinoma of pancreatic neck has always been a dilemma for surgeons. In this paper, we aim to investigate whether different surgical procedures can affect prognosis in the patient with adenocarcinoma of pancreatic neck. METHODS: We used the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results database to review patients with adenocarcinoma of pancreatic neck diagnosed between 1998 and 2015. We calculated overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) of these patients using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression model. RESULTS: Overall, 1443 patients were included in the study, with 12.5% treated with surgical resection. Among them, 30 (18.8%) patients underwent distal pancreatectomy (DP), 105 (65.6%) patients underwent pancreatoduodenectomy (PD), and 25 (15.6%) patients underwent total pancreatectomy (TP). Patients underwent DP were older than these underwent TP (70.5+/-10.7 vs. 62.2+/-14.1, P = 0.027). Patients underwent TP had higher percentages of nodal metastasis (N1 stage) than these underwent DP (68.0% vs. 34.5%, P = 0.014). The surgical procedures did not significantly affect either OS times (P = 0.924) or CSS times (P = 0.786) in Kaplan-Meier analysis, even if in any subgroup of AJCC stage. The multivariate Cox regression model showed that types of surgery were not associated with OS and CSS. Higher tumor grade and AJCC stage are independent prognostic factors for OS and CSS. No radiotherapy was associated with a worse CSS (HR 1.610, 95% CI 1.016-2.554, P = 0.043). CONCLUSION: Different surgical procedures did not affect prognosis in the patients with adenocarcinoma of pancreatic neck. TP should be performed in carefully selective patients in high-volume pancreatic centers.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 23810287\nTitle: Adjuvant therapy for resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma: review of the current treatment approaches and future directions.\nAuthors: Antoniou G, Kountourakis P, Papadimitriou K\nJournal: Cancer treatment reviews\nPublication Date: 2014 Feb\nAbstract: Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas carries a uniformly poor prognosis with high rates of loco-regional as well as systemic recurrence. Outcomes remain poor, even for early stage and resectable disease. It is perceived as inherently resistant to most of the currently available treatment options. Evidence supports the need for adjuvant chemotherapy but controversy remains in relation to the use of combined therapy, novel agents and the most appropriate timing of therapy. Despite no clear consensus, mainstay of treatment following resection is based primarily on single agent gemcitabine. Promising new agents and molecules of prognostic as well as predictive value under evaluation offer intriguing data, despite issues surrounding adjuvant therapy strategies. In this article, we sought to review the different therapeutic adjuvant modalities and future directions.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 30487695\nTitle: Pancreatic cancer: A review of clinical diagnosis, epidemiology, treatment and outcomes.\nAuthors: McGuigan A, Kelly P, Turkington RC\nJournal: World journal of gastroenterology\nPublication Date: 2018 Nov 21\nAbstract: This review aims to outline the most up-to-date knowledge of pancreatic adenocarcinoma risk, diagnostics, treatment and outcomes, while identifying gaps that aim to stimulate further research in this understudied malignancy. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a lethal condition with a rising incidence, predicted to become the second leading cause of cancer death in some regions. It often presents at an advanced stage, which contributes to poor five-year survival rates of 2%-9%, ranking firmly last amongst all cancer sites in terms of prognostic outcomes for patients. Better understanding of the risk factors and symptoms associated with this disease is essential to inform both health professionals and the general population of potential preventive and/or early detection measures. The identification of high-risk patients who could benefit from screening to detect pre-malignant conditions such as pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and mucinous cystic neoplasms is urgently required, however an acceptable screening test has yet to be identified. The management of pancreatic adenocarcinoma is evolving, with the introduction of new surgical techniques and medical therapies such as laparoscopic techniques and neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy, however this has only led to modest improvements in outcomes. The identification of novel biomarkers is desirable to move towards a precision medicine era, where pancreatic cancer therapy can be tailored to the individual patient, while unnecessary treatments that have negative consequences on quality of life could be prevented for others. Research efforts must also focus on the development of new agents and delivery systems. Overall, considerable progress is required to reduce the burden associated with pancreatic cancer. Recent, renewed efforts to fund large consortia and research into pancreatic adenocarcinoma are welcomed, but further streams will be necessary to facilitate the momentum needed to bring breakthroughs seen for other cancer sites.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

THE PATIENT'S CA 19-9 LAB TEST RESULTSS HAVE FLUCTUATED OVER TIME, WITH RECENT VALUES S BEING SIGNIFICANTLY ELEVATED (E.G., 32887 UNITS/ML AT AGE 62.877, AND 36658 UNITS/ML AT AGE 62.896).\n\nTHE PATIENT'S CANCER PRESENCE AND PROGRESSION HAVE BEEN MONITORED THROUGH CT AND PET SCANS, WITH MIXED RESULT S INDICATING BOTH PROGRESSION AND STABILITY AT DIFFERENT TIME S. THE MOST RECENT DIAGNOSIS AT AGE 62.767 INDICATE S THAT THE PATIENT HAS CANCER, WITH BOTH CT AND PET SCANS SHOWING EVIDENCE OF THE DISEASE.\n\nGIVEN THE AGGRESSIVE NATURE OF PANCREATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, THE PATIENT'S HISTORY OF RECURRENCE, AND THE RECENT LAB TEST RESULT S, IT'S REASONABLE TO CONCLUDE THAT THE PATIENT'S PROGNOSIS IS CHALLENGING. HOWEVER, THE PATIENT IS CURRENTLY 63 YEAR S OLD, AND THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THE PATIENT WILL BE ALIVE IN THE NEXT 12 MONTH S.\n\nCONSIDERING THE PROVIDED INFORMATION FROM PUBMED, WHICH INCLUDE S STUDIE S ON THE PROGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OUTCOME S OF PATIENT S WITH PANCREATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, IT APPEAR S THAT THE OVERALL SURVIVAL RATE FOR PATIENT S WITH THIS DISEASE IS GENERALLY POOR. HOWEVER, THE USE OF ADJUVANT THERAPY, INCLUDING CHEMOTHERAPY AND RADIOTHERAPY, MAY PROVIDE SOME BENEFIT IN TERM S OF SURVIVAL.\n\nTHEREFORE, BASED ON THE PATIENT'S CURRENT AGE, MEDICAL HISTORY, AND THE PROVIDED INFORMATION FROM PUBMED, I WOULD ESTIMATE THAT THE PATIENT HAS A POOR PROGNOSIS FOR SURVIVAL IN THE NEXT 12 MONTH S .\n\n[ANSWER: B]"
