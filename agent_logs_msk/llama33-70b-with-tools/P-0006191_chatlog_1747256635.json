MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who underwent curative resection for stage IB lung adenocarcinoma were analyzed with a newly developed recurrence risk scoring model and divided into a low-risk group and a high-risk group. The patients in the high-risk group were retrospectively divided into two groups based on whether they underwent adjuvant chemotherapy or observation. Recurrence-free survival and overall survival were compared between these two groups. RESULTS: A total of 328 patients who underwent curative resection between 2000 and 2009 were included in this study, of whom 110 (34%) received adjuvant chemotherapy and 218 (67%) underwent observation without additional treatment. According to our risk model, 167 patients (51%) were high-risk and 161 (49%) were low-risk. The 5-year recurrence-free survival rates and overall survival were 84.4% and 91.5% in low-risk patients and 53.9% and 74.7% in high-risk patients (p < 0.001). In high-risk patients, the 5-year overall survival rates were 77% among patients who underwent observation and 87% among those who underwent adjuvant chemotherapy (p=0.019). CONCLUSION: Adjuvant chemotherapy prolonged overall survival among high-risk patients who had undergone complete resection for stage IB lung adenocarcinoma.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 35274494\nTitle: Comparative survival analysis of platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy for early-stage squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the lung.\nAuthors: Hsiao SH, Chen WT, Chung CL\nJournal: Cancer medicine\nPublication Date: 2022 May\nAbstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although cytotoxic platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy (pACT) has been recommended for patients with completely resected early-stage (ES) non-small-cell lung cancer (ES-NSCLC), therapeutic regimens for NSCLC have evolved in the past two decades. The study was aimed to examine the effectiveness of postoperative pACT for resected ES-NSCLC patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or adenocarcinoma (ADC) according to real-world data. METHODS AND PATIENTS: Inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to adjust baseline characteristics between the group receiving pACT and those not receiving any treatment (observation, OBS) within 3 months after curative surgery. Cox regression models were used to compare overall survival (OS) and treatment failure-free survival (TFS) between the groups. RESULTS: Of 31,208 patients with ES-NSCLC, 4700 undergoing complete tumor resection were eligible, with a mean follow-up period of 4.5 years. The pACT (n = 2347) and OBS (n = 2353) groups were well-balanced after IPTW. The median OS differed between the pACT and OBS groups (77.2 vs. 75.5 months, adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.79-0.95, p = 0.003), and the 5-year survival rates were 58.2% and 55.3%, respectively (p < 0.001). In the SCC group, pACT was superior to OBS in OS (75.0 vs. 57.4 months, aHR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.62-0.88, p = 0.001) and TFS (32.7 vs. 21.8 months, aHR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.63-0.86, p < 0.001). Both OS and TFS did not differ between two groups in those with ADC. CONCLUSION: Real-world data indicated that pACT confers a survival benefit for resected ES-NSCLC patients with SCC but not ADC, which needs to be verified by a large sample of randomized controlled studies.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 32107626\nTitle: The prognostic factors of recurrence and survival in female patients with lung adenocarcinoma and breast cancer.\nAuthors: Chen YY, Huang YJ, Huang HK\nJournal: Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology\nPublication Date: 2020 May\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to verify the predictors of recurrence and survival in lung adenocarcinoma patients with experiences of breast cancer therapies. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients who were treated at our hospital for lung adenocarcinoma from 2004/01 to 2014/03. The patients were divided into groups of those with lung adenocarcinoma alone and those with lung and breast cancer. Kaplan-Meier plots and log-rank tests were used to estimate outcomes. RESULTS: 54 patients with lung adenocarcinoma and breast cancer were compared with 457 patients with single primary lung adenocarcinomas. After propensity score matching with control of age, operation type, smoking status and pathologic stage, tumor differentiation, recurrence rate and tumor size were significantly different between two groups. The significant predictors for recurrence included undergone chemotherapy (HR = 25, p < 0.001), moderate/poor differentiation (HR = 8.125, p = 0.012), tumor size >== 2 cm (HR = 15, p < 0.001), LVSI (HR = 13.67, p = 0.031) and GGO ratio < 50% (HR = 14.667, p = 0.014). The significant prognostic factors for survival were accepted chemotherapy (HR = 6.182, p = 0.021), LVSI (HR = 22, p = 0.012) and GGO ratio < 50% (HR = 9.143, p = 0.045). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with lung adenocarcinoma and breast cancer had a better 5-year disease-free survival (p = 0.009), while the Her2-negative patients obtained a better overall survival (p = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with breast cancer and lung adenocarcinoma, independent risk factors of recurrence were undergone chemotherapy, moderate/poor differentiation, tumor size >== 2 cm, LVSI and GGO ratio < 50%. Only undergone chemotherapy, LVSI and GGO ratio < 50% were significant poor predictors for survival. However, patients with metachronous lung adenocarcinoma and breast cancer had better disease-free survival and less tumor recurrence than patients with lung adenocarcinoma alone.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

In patients with EGFR mutations, those with early p-stage tumors showed better survival after disease recurrence than those with advanced p-stage tumors. The EGFR mutation status and p-stage could also prompt the design of clinical trials on adjuvant therapy for patients after complete surgical resection. BACKGROUND: The current staging system and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status are key factors for predicting survival. However, the significance of these factors as predictors of survival after disease recurrence (PRS) has not been sufficiently elucidated. The objective of this study was to investigate the clinicopathological factors, particularly the EGFR mutation status and pathological stage (p-stage), which affect PRS in patients with completely resected lung adenocarcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the data of 198 consecutive lung adenocarcinoma patients with disease recurrence who previously underwent complete surgical resection in our hospital. RESULTS: Of the 198 patients, 117 were examined for EGFR mutations (mutants). Mutants were detected in 57 patients (28.7%). The patients with mutants had a significantly better 3-year PRS (3y-PRS) rate (68.6%) than those with an EGFR wild type (WT) status (51.7%) or an unknown (UN) status (27.0%). The 3y-PRS rates for p-stage I to II (p-I-II) and p-stage III (p-III) were 52.5% and 29.3%, respectively. Multivariate survival analysis showed that the EGFR mutation status and p-stage had significant associations with favorable PRS. The 3y-PRS rate for mutants/p-I-II (81.4%) was significantly better than that for mutants/p-III (48.0%). Conversely, there was no significant difference between mutants/p-III and WT/UN/p-I-II (3y-PRS: 40.7%) or between mutants/p-III and WT/UN/p-III (3y-PRS: 24.4%). CONCLUSION: EGFR status and p-stage were shown to be essential prognostic factors for estimating PRS. In patients with mutants, those with early p-stage tumors showed better PRS than those with advanced p-stage tumors.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 39960662\nTitle: Development and validation of a transcription factor regulatory network-based signature for individualized prognostic risk in lung adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Wang K, Xiang J, Zhou J\nJournal: International journal of cancer\nPublication Date: 2025 Jun 15\nAbstract: Despite significant progress in diagnostic and therapeutic modalities, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) still exhibits a high recurrence risk and a low 5-year survival rate. Reliable prognostic signatures are imperative for risk stratification in LUAD patients. This study encompassed 2740 patients from 23 LUAD cohorts, including one single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset, five bulk RNA-seq datasets, and 17 microarray datasets. Using scRNA-seq dataset, we defined a group of epithelial-specific transcription factors significantly over-represented in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) gene set (enrichment ratio [ER] = 5.80, Fisher's exact test p < .001), and the corresponding target genes were significantly enriched in the cancer driver gene set (ER = 2.74, p < .001), indicating of their crucial roles in the EMT process and tumor progression. We constructed a single-cell gene pairs (scGPS) signature, composed of 3521 gene pairs derived from the epithelial cell-specific transcription factor regulatory network, to predict overall survival (OS) of LUAD. High-risk patients identified by scGPS in the discovery cohort exhibited significantly worse OS compared to low-risk patients (Hazard ratio [HR] = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.29-2.46, log-rank p = 1.80 x 10(-4)). The scGPS outperformed other established gene signatures and demonstrated robust prognostic stratification across various independent datasets, including microarray data and even early-stage LUAD patients. It remained an independent prognostic factor after adjusting for clinical and pathologic factors. In addition, combining scGPS with tumor stage further enhanced prognostic accuracy compared to using stage alone. The scGPS signature offers individualized prognosis estimations, showing significant potential for practical application in clinical settings.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 34454901\nTitle: Outcomes After Surgical Resection of Early-stage Lung Adenocarcinomas With Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutations.\nAuthors: Chow OS, Villena-Vargas J, Nasar A\nJournal: The Annals of thoracic surgery\nPublication Date: 2022 Sep\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Routine mutation profiling for resected lung cancers is not widespread despite an increasing array of targeted therapies. We report the incidence of epidermal growth factor receptor mutations (EGFRmu+) in resected lung adenocarcinomas and their outcomes at a large North American cancer center to characterize this population now eligible for targeted adjuvant therapy. METHODS: Among 1036 pulmonary resections performed between 2015 and 2019, 647 patients (62%) had adenocarcinomas that underwent molecular profiling by next-generation sequencing. Clinical and pathologic characteristics, along with survival, were analyzed. RESULTS: EGFRmu+ were identified in 238 patients (37%). Patients with EGFRmu+ were more likely to be Asian than those with EGFR wild-type (79/238 [33%] vs 37/409 [9%], respectively; P < .001) and more likely to be never-smokers (115/238 [48%] vs 73/409 [18%], P < .001). However, most patients with EGFRmu+ in our cohort were White (45%) and had a history of smoking (52%). A statistically nonsignificant trend was observed toward improved 3-year overall survival for pathologic stage IB to III cancers with EGFRmu+ (91% vs 77%, P = .09). Patients with pathologic stage IB lung cancers with EGFRmu+ had a 97% rate of 3-year disease-free survival, with only 1 recurrence in the first 3 years of follow-up. EGFR mutation subtype was not associated with survival differences. CONCLUSIONS: Although Asians and never-smokers comprised a disproportionately large group of patients with lung adenocarcinomas with EGFRmu+, most EGFR mutations within our cohort were found in patients who were White or with a smoking history, supporting a routine rather than selective approach to mutation profiling. Patients with surgically resected stage IA and IB lung adenocarcinomas enjoy excellent survival regardless of their mutational status.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
