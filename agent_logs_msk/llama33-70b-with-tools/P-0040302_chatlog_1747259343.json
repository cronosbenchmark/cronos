Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0040302-T01-IM6\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0040302\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Pancreatic Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Pancreas\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT468\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 595, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 20.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"PAAD\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

Because of the special anatomic features of pancreatic neck, the selection of optimal surgical procedure for treatment of adenocarcinoma of pancreatic neck has always been a dilemma for surgeons. In this paper, we aim to investigate whether different surgical procedures can affect prognosis in the patient with adenocarcinoma of pancreatic neck. METHODS: We used the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results database to review patients with adenocarcinoma of pancreatic neck diagnosed between 1998 and 2015. We calculated overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) of these patients using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression model. RESULTS: Overall, 1443 patients were included in the study, with 12.5% treated with surgical resection. Among them, 30 (18.8%) patients underwent distal pancreatectomy (DP), 105 (65.6%) patients underwent pancreatoduodenectomy (PD), and 25 (15.6%) patients underwent total pancreatectomy (TP). Patients underwent DP were older than these underwent TP (70.5+/-10.7 vs. 62.2+/-14.1, P = 0.027). Patients underwent TP had higher percentages of nodal metastasis (N1 stage) than these underwent DP (68.0% vs. 34.5%, P = 0.014). The surgical procedures did not significantly affect either OS times (P = 0.924) or CSS times (P = 0.786) in Kaplan-Meier analysis, even if in any subgroup of AJCC stage. The multivariate Cox regression model showed that types of surgery were not associated with OS and CSS. Higher tumor grade and AJCC stage are independent prognostic factors for OS and CSS. No radiotherapy was associated with a worse CSS (HR 1.610, 95% CI 1.016-2.554, P = 0.043). CONCLUSION: Different surgical procedures did not affect prognosis in the patients with adenocarcinoma of pancreatic neck. TP should be performed in carefully selective patients in high-volume pancreatic centers.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 23810287\nTitle: Adjuvant therapy for resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma: review of the current treatment approaches and future directions.\nAuthors: Antoniou G, Kountourakis P, Papadimitriou K\nJournal: Cancer treatment reviews\nPublication Date: 2014 Feb\nAbstract: Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas carries a uniformly poor prognosis with high rates of loco-regional as well as systemic recurrence. Outcomes remain poor, even for early stage and resectable disease. It is perceived as inherently resistant to most of the currently available treatment options. Evidence supports the need for adjuvant chemotherapy but controversy remains in relation to the use of combined therapy, novel agents and the most appropriate timing of therapy. Despite no clear consensus, mainstay of treatment following resection is based primarily on single agent gemcitabine. Promising new agents and molecules of prognostic as well as predictive value under evaluation offer intriguing data, despite issues surrounding adjuvant therapy strategies. In this article, we sought to review the different therapeutic adjuvant modalities and future directions.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 30487695\nTitle: Pancreatic cancer: A review of clinical diagnosis, epidemiology, treatment and outcomes.\nAuthors: McGuigan A, Kelly P, Turkington RC\nJournal: World journal of gastroenterology\nPublication Date: 2018 Nov 21\nAbstract: This review aims to outline the most up-to-date knowledge of pancreatic adenocarcinoma risk, diagnostics, treatment and outcomes, while identifying gaps that aim to stimulate further research in this understudied malignancy. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a lethal condition with a rising incidence, predicted to become the second leading cause of cancer death in some regions. It often presents at an advanced stage, which contributes to poor five-year survival rates of 2%-9%, ranking firmly last amongst all cancer sites in terms of prognostic outcomes for patients. Better understanding of the risk factors and symptoms associated with this disease is essential to inform both health professionals and the general population of potential preventive and/or early detection measures. The identification of high-risk patients who could benefit from screening to detect pre-malignant conditions such as pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and mucinous cystic neoplasms is urgently required, however an acceptable screening test has yet to be identified. The management of pancreatic adenocarcinoma is evolving, with the introduction of new surgical techniques and medical therapies such as laparoscopic techniques and neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy, however this has only led to modest improvements in outcomes. The identification of novel biomarkers is desirable to move towards a precision medicine era, where pancreatic cancer therapy can be tailored to the individual patient, while unnecessary treatments that have negative consequences on quality of life could be prevented for others. Research efforts must also focus on the development of new agents and delivery systems. Overall, considerable progress is required to reduce the burden associated with pancreatic cancer. Recent, renewed efforts to fund large consortia and research into pancreatic adenocarcinoma are welcomed, but further streams will be necessary to facilitate the momentum needed to bring breakthroughs seen for other cancer sites.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

In this study, we identified prognostic factors for survival and recurrence in patients with histologically proven pancreatic adenocarcinoma. METHODOLOGY: Between January 2003 and December 2009, 82 patients with histologically proven pancreatic adenocarcinoma were considered for this study. Follow-up consisted of personal contact with patients or review of electronic medical records at this center and was terminated on December 31, 2011 or upon the patient's death. RESULTS: Overall survival rates of all patients at 1, 3, and 5 years were 51.9, 21.6 and 16.0%. Preoperative jaundice was the only independent prognostic factor for total pancreatic cancer patients, while N stage and perineural invasion in pathological findings was identified as an independent prognostic factor for survival of patients with surgical resection. Chemotherapy was the only independent prognostic factor for survival of patients who underwent palliative surgical bypass. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative jaundice in any patients, lymph node metastasis, perineural invasion in patients with surgical resection, and chemotherapy in patients undergoing palliative surgical bypass are important prognostic factors for survival of pancreatic cancer.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 21924695\nTitle: Prognostic factors for resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Neuzillet C, Sauvanet A, Hammel P\nJournal: Journal of visceral surgery\nPublication Date: 2011 Sep\nAbstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma represents 90% of pancreatic cancers and the fifth cause of cancer death in Western countries. Overall survival rate at 5 years is less than 5%. Surgical resection is still the only treatment providing prolonged survival but, even after a curative resection, 5-year survival rates are low. However, some patients have a slower tumor progression and increased median survival due to treatment advances and better patient selection. The objective of this review is to analyze the prognostic factors related to patient, treatment and tumor, to identify those associated with better long-term survival after resection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 31317756\nTitle: Survival, morbidity and mortality of pancreatic adenocarcinoma after pancreaticoduodenectomy with a total mesopancreas excision.\nAuthors: Sanchez Acedo P, Herrera Cabezon J, Zazpe Ripa C\nJournal: Revista espanola de enfermedades digestivas\nPublication Date: 2019 Aug\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION: pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the most common malignancy in the periampullary region, with a five-year survival rate around 20%. OBJECTIVE: the goal of our study was to determine the survival and safety data of a number of patients that underwent a cephalic duodenopancreatectomy (CDP) with total mesopancreas excision (TMPE). MATERIAL AND METHODS: a prospective observational study was performed of 114 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma who underwent duodenopancreatectomy and TMPE over the period 2008-2017. Demographic variables, tumor stage, number of lymph nodes excised, lymph node ratio, R classification, the prognostic factor disease-free interval and survival were all assessed in a multivariate analysis. RESULTS: complications were reported for 54 (47.3%) patients, of which 22 (19.3%) were categorized as serious. The mortality rate was 4.3% and the mean follow-up was 26.2 months. During this period, 73 (64%) patients relapsed after a mean interval of 40.9 months. The relapse pattern was mainly hepatic (26.3%), followed by local relapse (20%). Mean survival was 40.38 and actuarial survival was 26.6% at five years. Relapse-related factors included stage T3 or higher (RR 8.1 [1.1-61]) and an R1 resection (RR 13.4 [2.7-66.5]) and survival-related factors included an R1 resection (RR 10.7 [2.5-46.2]). CONCLUSION: TMPE ensures an adequate lymphadenectomy and lymph node ratio according to reported standards. The survival of patients that have undergone surgery for pancreatic adenocarcinoma in our institution is 68.4% at one year and 26.6% at five years. An R1 resection is the primary factor for both relapse and survival.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
