Oxaliplatin: Oxaliplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0022916-T01-IM6\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0022916\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Colorectal Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Rectum\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Rectal Adenocarcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT468\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 777, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 30.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"READ\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

Less is known regarding the comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these agents among elderly patients. Whether the benefits of these agents justify the additional costs for elderly Medicare recipients is particularly policy relevant after US health care reform. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis of oxaliplatin-based or irinotecan-based combination therapy versus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone in elderly stage IV colon cancer patients was performed from a US Medicare perspective. Survival and direct medical costs were estimated using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data sets for patients diagnosed from 2002 to 2005 with follow-up through 2007. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated as costs per life-year gained, with sensitivity analysis estimating the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS: Median improved overall survival with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone, or irinotecan-based or oxaliplatin-based combination therapy was 0.99, 1.07, and 1.47 life-years, respectively. Costs per life-year gained for oxaliplatin-based or irinotecan-based combination regimens compared with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone were $78,181 and $267,938, respectively. ICERs comparing oxaliplatin-based to irinotecan-based regimens were $40,230 per life-year gained or $160,920 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Oxaliplatin-based or irinotecan-based combination therapy improves overall survival but also substantially increases direct medical costs compared with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone when used in elderly US patients with stage IV colon cancer. Oxaliplatin-based regimens are more cost-effective than irinotecan-based regimens for treatment of elderly stage IV colon cancer patients in terms of cost per life-year gained, but not in terms of cost per QALY.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 19145671\nTitle: Biweekly oxaliplatin, fluorouracil and leucovorin versus cisplatin, fluorouracil and leucovorin in patients with advanced gastric cancer.\nAuthors: Popov I, Radosevic-Jelic L, Jezdic S\nJournal: Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology\nPublication Date: 2008 Oct-Dec\nAbstract: PURPOSE: To compare a bi-weekly infusion of leucovorin (LV) 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for 2 days, plus oxaliplatin (LV5- FU2-oxaliplatin) and LV5-FU2-cisplatin (CDDP) regimens with respect to toxicity, objective response rates, time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced gastric cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received LV5-FU2- oxaliplatin (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2), day 1; folinic acid 200 mg/m(2), days 1-2; 5-FU 400 mg/m(2), i.v. bolus, days 1-2; 5-FU 600 mg/m(2), 22-hour continuous infusion, days 1-2) or LV5- FU2-CDDP (CDDP 50 mg/m(2), day 1; plus LV5-FU2). A total of 72 patients were enrolled into this study (36 vs. 36). RESULTS: A total of 305 cycles were administered in the LV5-FU2-oxaliplatin arm (median 8) and 272 cycles in the LV5-FU2-CDDP arm (median 8). Grades 3-4 toxicity were as follows (LV5-FU2-oxaliplatin %/LV5-FU2-CDDP %; p<0.05): neutropenia 5/49, thrombocytopenia 2/6, anemia 6/16 nausea/vomiting 2/15, and mucositis 0/3. Response rate of LV5-FU2-oxaliplatin was 41% (partial response/PR 41%, stable disease/SD 31%, progressive disease/PD 28%; 95% confidence internal/95% CI 27-58) and of LV5-FU2-CDDP was 25% (PR 25%, SD 36%, PD 39%; 95% CI 14-41; p =0.013). The median TTP of the patients in the LV5-FU2-oxaliplatin arm was 8 months and 6 months for those in the LV5- FU2-CDDP arm (p=0.073). The median survival time of the patients in the LV5-FU2-oxaliplatin arm was 10 months and 7 months for those in the LV5-FU2-CDDP arm (p=0.003). CONCLUSION: Our study showed that oxaliplatin may be substituted for cisplatin with LV5-FU2 with favorable safety and efficacy profile. The encouraging results from our study support the effectiveness of oxaliplatin-fluoropyrimidine- containing chemotherapy in gastric cancer and could provide a new core on which to add other agents in future investigations.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 36529949\nTitle: Hepatic Arterial Infusion of Oxaliplatin, Fluorouracil, and Leucovorin Versus Sorafenib for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Refractory to Transarterial Chemoembolization: Retrospective Subgroup Analysis of 2 Prospective Trials.\nAuthors: Huang Y, Zhang L, He M\nJournal: Technology in cancer research & treatment\nPublication Date: 2022 Jan-Dec\nAbstract: Purpose:Sorafenib is recommended for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma refractory to transarterial chemoembolization but with unsatisfactory overall survival and tumor response rate. Previously published studies showed hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy of oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin was an effective and safe treatment. The aims of this study were to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin-based hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy with sorafenib in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma refractory to transarterial chemoembolization. Methods: This was a retrospective subgroup analysis of 2 prospective clinical trials, including 114 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who were confirmed to be transarterial chemoembolization refractoriness. Of these, 55 patients received hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy of fluorouracil, and leucovorin (FOLFOX-HAIC group, oxaliplatin 85 or 130 mg/m(2), leucovorin 400 mg/m(2), fluorouracil bolus 400 mg/m(2), and 2400 mg/m(2) for 23 or 46 h, every 3 weeks), and 59 patients were treated with sorafenib (sorafenib group, 400 mg sorafenib twice daily). Overall survival, progression-free survival, objective response rate, and treatment-related adverse events were compared between the 2 groups. Results: The FOLFOX-HAIC group showed a longer overall survival (17.1 months [95% confidence interval 13.4-20.8] vs 9.1 months [95% confidence interval 7.5-10.6]; hazard ratio 0.35 [95% confidence interval 0.23-0.53]; P < .001), a higher objective response rate (RECIST: 18 [32.7%] vs 1 [1.7%], P < .001), and a longer progression-free survival (7.6 months [95% confidence interval 5.6-9.6] vs 3.9 months [95% confidence interval 2.3-5.4]; hazard ratio 0.49 [95% confidence interval 0.33-0.72]; P < .001) than the sorafenib group. The safety results suggested that both oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin-based hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy and sorafenib had acceptable treatment-related toxic effects. No significant difference was observed in the overall occurrence of any grade, grade 3/4, or serious adverse events between the 2 groups. Conclusions: Oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin-based hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy might be a better choice than sorafenib for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma refractory to transarterial chemoembolization.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

administered by rapid injection. Floxuridine is available as a sterile, nonpyrogenic, lyophilized powder for reconstitution. When administered by slow, continuous, intra-arterial infusion, it is converted to floxuridine monophosphate. It has been used to treat hepatic metastases of gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and for palliation in malignant neoplasms of the liver and gastrointestinal tract.\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nUridine: nan\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"
