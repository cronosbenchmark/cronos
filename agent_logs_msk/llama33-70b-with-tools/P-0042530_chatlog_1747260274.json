chemotherapy drug in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0042530-T01-IM6\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0042530\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Pancreatic Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Pancreas\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT468\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 570, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 10.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"PAAD\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

In this study, we identified prognostic factors for survival and recurrence in patients with histologically proven pancreatic adenocarcinoma. METHODOLOGY: Between January 2003 and December 2009, 82 patients with histologically proven pancreatic adenocarcinoma were considered for this study. Follow-up consisted of personal contact with patients or review of electronic medical records at this center and was terminated on December 31, 2011 or upon the patient's death. RESULTS: Overall survival rates of all patients at 1, 3, and 5 years were 51.9, 21.6 and 16.0%. Preoperative jaundice was the only independent prognostic factor for total pancreatic cancer patients, while N stage and perineural invasion in pathological findings was identified as an independent prognostic factor for survival of patients with surgical resection. Chemotherapy was the only independent prognostic factor for survival of patients who underwent palliative surgical bypass. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative jaundice in any patients, lymph node metastasis, perineural invasion in patients with surgical resection, and chemotherapy in patients undergoing palliative surgical bypass are important prognostic factors for survival of pancreatic cancer.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 37185395\nTitle: Early Recurrence after Upfront Surgery for Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Nappo G, Donisi G, Capretti G\nJournal: Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)\nPublication Date: 2023 Mar 27\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Survival after surgery for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains poor, due to early recurrence (ER) of the disease. A global definition of ER is lacking and different cut-off values (6, 8, and 12 months) have been adopted. The aims of this study were to define the optimal cut-off for the definition of ER and predictive factors for ER. METHODS: Recurrence was recorded for all consecutive patients undergoing upfront surgery for PDAC at our institute between 2010 and 2017. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were utilized, to estimate the optimal cut-off for the definition of ER as a predictive factor for poor post-progression survival (PPS). To identify predictive factors of ER, univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used. RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty one cases were retrospectively evaluated. The recurrence rate was 76.9%. ER rates were 29.0%, 37.6%, and 47.6%, when adopting 6, 8, and 12 months as cut-offs, respectively. A significant difference in median PPS was only shown between ER and late recurrence using 12 months as cut-off (p = 0.005). In the multivariate analysis, a pre-operative value of CA 19-9 > 70.5 UI/L (OR 3.10 (1.41-6.81); p = 0.005) and the omission of adjuvant treatment (OR 0.18 (0.08-0.41); p < 0.001) were significant predictive factors of ER. CONCLUSIONS: A twelve-months cut-off should be adopted for the definition of ER. Almost 50% of upfront-resected patients presented ER, and it significantly affected the prognosis. A high preoperative value of CA 19-9 and the omission of adjuvant treatment were the only predictive factors for ER.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 30945087\nTitle: Clinicopathological Features, Recurrence Patterns, and Prognosis of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma with Normal Serum CA19-9.

The clinicopathological features, survival, and recurrence patterns were compared between two groups. We also sought to identify factors that best predicted prognosis in pancreatic adenocarcinoma with normal CA19-9 levels, to assist in the selection of the most effective adjuvant treatment. RESULTS: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma with normal CA19-9 were less likely to have lymph node metastasis, angiolymphatic invasion, intrapancreatic neural invasion, anterior serosal invasion, and invasion of the surrounding tissue/organ (distal bile duct, duodenum, or splenic artery or vein). Following propensity-score matching, pancreatic adenocarcinoma with normal CA19-9 levels (</= 37 U/ml) were associated with significantly superior overall survival following resection. Moreover, the CA19-9 </= 37 U/mL group demonstrated a significantly lower rate of local recurrence (35.57% vs. 52.35%, p = 0.004), distant recurrence (42.95% vs. 60.4%, p = 0.003), and mixed recurrence (5.37% vs. 29.53%, p < 0.000) compared with the CA19-9 > 37 U/mL group. Multivariate analysis suggested that angiolymphatic invasion, lymph node metastases, and tumor size > 3 cm were independent prognostic factors for pancreatic adenocarcinoma with normal CA19-9. Survival analyses suggested that post-op chemoradiotherapy or chemotherapy were associated with more favorable outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma with normal pretreatment CA19-9 levels (</= 37 U/ml) were characterized by better biological characteristics, reduced rates of recurrence, and longer overall survival. Moreover, optimal adjuvant therapy should be performed after surgery.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Overall, the 5-year survival rate among all pancreatic cancer patients is less than 9%; these rates have shown little change over the past 30 years. A more comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying this complex disease is crucial to the development of new diagnostic tools for early detection and disease monitoring, as well as to identify new and more effective therapeutics to improve patient outcomes. AREA COVERED: We summarize recent advances in proteomic strategies and mass spectrometry to identify new biomarkers for early detection and monitoring of disease progression, predict response to therapy, and to identify novel proteins that have the potential to be 'druggable' therapeutic targets. An overview of proteomic studies that have been conducted to further our mechanistic understanding of metastasis and chemotherapy resistance in PDAC disease progression will also be discussed. EXPERT COMMENTARY: The results from these PDAC proteomic studies on a variety of PDAC sample types (e.g., blood, tissue, cell lines, exosomes, etc.) provide great promise of having a significant clinical impact and improving patient outcomes.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 39155683\nTitle: Chemotherapy switch for nonresponse or progression on neoadjuvant chemotherapy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Hagerty BL, Fekrmandi F, Schneider T\nJournal: Journal of surgical oncology\nPublication Date: 2024 Oct\nAbstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Patients with localized pancreatic adenocarcinoma who do not respond to neoadjuvant therapy present a challenge. We sought to define the characteristics and outcomes of those patients to guide clinical practice. METHODS: Patients included were those without evidence of biochemical or radiographic response and no evidence of distant progression at the first reassessment after initiation of therapy. RESULTS: Of the 45 patients in the cohort, 23 (51.1%) proceeded to surgical exploration with all but one of those undergoing resection. The median overall survival of the study cohort was 28.6 and 48.6 months in those who underwent resection. A total of 13 patients (28.9%) underwent chemotherapy switch (CS) during their course of neoadjuvant therapy. The CS cohort demonstrated higher rates of radiologic progression (25% vs. 10%, p = 0.329), new or worse vascular involvement (58.3% vs. 30%, p = 0.082), and CA 19-9 increase (30.8% vs. 12.9%, p = 0.209) at initial re-staging. Despite this, overall survival was similar between the two groups (20.7 vs. 28.7 months, p = 0.674). CONCLUSION: Non-responders to first-line neoadjuvant therapy have poor rates of curative-intent resection. However, resection should be undertaken when feasible. CS may be considered in patients who do not respond to first-line chemotherapy.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 21924695\nTitle: Prognostic factors for resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Neuzillet C, Sauvanet A, Hammel P\nJournal: Journal of visceral surgery\nPublication Date: 2011 Sep\nAbstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma represents 90% of pancreatic cancers and the fifth cause of cancer death in Western countries. Overall survival rate at 5 years is less than 5%. Surgical resection is still the only treatment providing prolonged survival but, even after a curative resection, 5-year survival rates are low. However, some patients have a slower tumor progression and increased median survival due to treatment advances and better patient selection. The objective of this review is to analyze the prognostic factors related to patient, treatment and tumor, to identify those associated with better long-term survival after resection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

OBJECTIVE: the goal of our study was to determine the survival and safety data of a number of patients that underwent a cephalic duodenopancreatectomy (CDP) with total mesopancreas excision (TMPE). MATERIAL AND METHODS: a prospective observational study was performed of 114 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma who underwent duodenopancreatectomy and TMPE over the period 2008-2017. Demographic variables, tumor stage, number of lymph nodes excised, lymph node ratio, R classification, the prognostic factor disease-free interval and survival were all assessed in a multivariate analysis. RESULTS: complications were reported for 54 (47.3%) patients, of which 22 (19.3%) were categorized as serious. The mortality rate was 4.3% and the mean follow-up was 26.2 months. During this period, 73 (64%) patients relapsed after a mean interval of 40.9 months. The relapse pattern was mainly hepatic (26.3%), followed by local relapse (20%). Mean survival was 40.38 and actuarial survival was 26.6% at five years. Relapse-related factors included stage T3 or higher (RR 8.1 [1.1-61]) and an R1 resection (RR 13.4 [2.7-66.5]) and survival-related factors included an R1 resection (RR 10.7 [2.5-46.2]). CONCLUSION: TMPE ensures an adequate lymphadenectomy and lymph node ratio according to reported standards. The survival of patients that have undergone surgery for pancreatic adenocarcinoma in our institution is 68.4% at one year and 26.6% at five years. An R1 resection is the primary factor for both relapse and survival.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 11569683\nTitle: Long term survival after pancreatic resection for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Ahmad NA, Lewis JD, Ginsberg GG\nJournal: The American journal of gastroenterology\nPublication Date: 2001 Sep\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the long term survival of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma who underwent surgical resection and to assess the association of clinical, pathological, and treatment features with survival. METHODS: Between January, 1990, and December, 1998, 125 patients underwent a pancreaticoduodenal or partial pancreatic resection for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma at our institution. The records of these patients were reviewed for demographics, tumor characteristics including size, histological grade, margin status, lymph node status, surgical TNM staging, and postoperative adjuvant therapy. The primary outcome variable analyzed was survival. RESULTS: A total of 116 patients had complete follow-up and were included in the final analysis. The median survival after surgery was 16 months. The 1-, 3-, 5-, and 7-yr survival rates for all 116 patients were 60%, 23%, 19%, and 11%, respectively. The 1-, 3-, 5-, and 7-yr survival rates for patients who received adjuvant therapy were 69%, 28%, 23%, and 18% compared with 20% and 0% in patients who did not receive adjuvant therapy (p < 0.0001). The 1-, 3-, 5-, and 7-yr survival rates for patients with negative lymph nodes were 73%, 38%, 26%, and 22% compared with survival rates of 52%, 14%, 14%, and 9% in patients with positive lymph nodes (p = 0.01). In multivariate analyses, adjuvant therapy was the only feature found to be strongly associated with survival (hazards ratio = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.15-0.44). CONCLUSIONS: The overall 5- and 7-yr survival rates of 19% and 11% in our study further validate that surgical resection in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma can result in long term survival, particularly when performed in association with adjuvant chemoradiation.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 23574658\nTitle: Prognostic factors associated with long-term survival and recurrence in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Lee SR, Kim HO, Son BH\nJournal: Hepato-gastroenterology\nPublication Date: 2013 Mar-Apr\nAbstract: BACKGROUND/AIMS: It is very important to determine the prognostic factors for pancreatic adenocarcinoma when choosing surgical and conservative management strategies. In this study, we identified prognostic factors for survival and recurrence in patients with histologically proven pancreatic adenocarcinoma. METHODOLOGY: Between January 2003 and December 2009, 82 patients with histologically proven pancreatic adenocarcinoma were considered for this study. Follow-up consisted of personal contact with patients or review of electronic medical records at this center and was terminated on December 31, 2011 or upon the patient's death. RESULTS: Overall survival rates of all patients at 1, 3, and 5 years were 51.9, 21.6 and 16.0%. Preoperative jaundice was the only independent prognostic factor for total pancreatic cancer patients, while N stage and perineural invasion in pathological findings was identified as an independent prognostic factor for survival of patients with surgical resection. Chemotherapy was the only independent prognostic factor for survival of patients who underwent palliative surgical bypass. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative jaundice in any patients, lymph node metastasis, perineural invasion in patients with surgical resection, and chemotherapy in patients undergoing palliative surgical bypass are important prognostic factors for survival of pancreatic cancer.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: A clear definition of \"early recurrence\" after pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma resection is currently lacking. METHODS: Patients undergoing pancreatectomy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma between 2000 and 2013 were included. Exclusion criteria were neoadjuvant therapy and incomplete follow-up. A minimum P-value approach was used to evaluate the optimal cut-off value of recurrence-free survival to divide the patients into early and late recurrence cohorts based on subsequent prognosis. Potential risk factors for early recurrence were assessed with logistic regression models. RESULTS: Of 957 included patients, 204 (21.3%) were recurrence-free at last follow-up. The optimal length of recurrence-free survival to distinguish between early (n = 388, 51.5%) and late recurrence (n = 365, 48.5%) was 12 months (P < 0.001). Patients with early recurrence had 1-, and 2-year post-recurrence survival rates of 20 and 6% compared with 45 and 22% for the late recurrence group (both P < 0.001). Preoperative risk factors for early recurrence included a Charlson age-comorbidity index >/=4 (OR 1.65), tumor size > 3.0 cm on computed tomography (OR 1.53) and CA 19-9 > 210 U/mL (OR 2.30). Postoperative risk factors consisted of poor tumor differentiation grade (OR 1.66), microscopic lymphovascular invasion (OR 1.70), a lymph node ratio > 0.2 (OR 2.49), and CA 19-9 > 37 U/mL (OR 3.38). Adjuvant chemotherapy (OR 0.28) and chemoradiotherapy (OR 0.29) were associated with a reduced likelihood of early recurrence. CONCLUSION: A recurrence-free interval of 12 months is the optimal threshold for differentiating between early and late recurrence, based on subsequent prognosis.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 37185395\nTitle: Early Recurrence after Upfront Surgery for Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Nappo G, Donisi G, Capretti G\nJournal: Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)\nPublication Date: 2023 Mar 27\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Survival after surgery for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains poor, due to early recurrence (ER) of the disease. A global definition of ER is lacking and different cut-off values (6, 8, and 12 months) have been adopted. The aims of this study were to define the optimal cut-off for the definition of ER and predictive factors for ER. METHODS: Recurrence was recorded for all consecutive patients undergoing upfront surgery for PDAC at our institute between 2010 and 2017. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were utilized, to estimate the optimal cut-off for the definition of ER as a predictive factor for poor post-progression survival (PPS). To identify predictive factors of ER, univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used. RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty one cases were retrospectively evaluated. The recurrence rate was 76.9%. ER rates were 29.0%, 37.6%, and 47.6%, when adopting 6, 8, and 12 months as cut-offs, respectively. A significant difference in median PPS was only shown between ER and late recurrence using 12 months as cut-off (p = 0.005). In the multivariate analysis, a pre-operative value of CA 19-9 > 70.5 UI/L (OR 3.10 (1.41-6.81); p = 0.005) and the omission of adjuvant treatment (OR 0.18 (0.08-0.41); p < 0.001) were significant predictive factors of ER. CONCLUSIONS: A twelve-months cut-off should be adopted for the definition of ER. Almost 50% of upfront-resected patients presented ER, and it significantly affected the prognosis. A high preoperative value of CA 19-9 and the omission of adjuvant treatment were the only predictive factors for ER.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 35974774\nTitle: Analysis of preoperative risk factors for early recurrence after curative pancreatoduodenectomy for resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Burasakarn P, Thienhiran A, Fuengfoo P\nJournal: Innovative surgical sciences\nPublication Date: 2022 Mar 1\nAbstract: OBJECTIVES: To investigate the risk factors for early recurrence after curative pancreatoduodenectomy for resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. METHODS: All data were retrospectively collected from patients with resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma who had undergone pancreatoduodenectomy at the Department of Surgery, Phramongkutklao Hospital, from January 2015 to December 2020. The preoperative and perioperative risk factors were included into the analysis. RESULTS: In total, 34 patients were included in the study. The median time for recurrence and median survival time were 17 and 20 months, respectively. The 1, 3, and 5 year disease-free survival rates were 59.6%, 23.87%, and 23.87%, respectively, while the 1, 3, and 5 year overall survival rates were 81%, 24.7%, and 12.4%, respectively. Seventeen patients (50%) from a total of 34 patients had recurrence, and ten patients (29.41%) had recurrence within 12 months. The independent preoperative risk factor associated with adverse disease-free survival was tumor size > 4 cm (hazard ratio [HR], 14.34, p=0.022). The perioperative risk factors associated with adverse disease-free survival were pathological lymphovascular invasion (HR, 4.31; p=0.048) and non-hepatopancreatobiliary surgeon (HR, 5.9; p=0.022). Risk factors associated with poor overall survival were microscopical margin positive (R1) resection (HR, 3.68; p=0.019) and non-hepatopancreatobiliary surgeon (HR, 3.45; p=0.031). CONCLUSIONS: Tumor size > 4 cm from the preoperative imaging study was a poor prognostic factor for early recurrence after curative pancreatoduodenectomy for resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma indicated that they may have radiological occult metastasis, thus, staging laparoscopy may reduce the number of unnecessary laparotomies and avoid missing radiologically negative metastases.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
