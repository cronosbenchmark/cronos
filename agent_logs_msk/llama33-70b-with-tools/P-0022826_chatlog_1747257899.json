Local recurrence was a component of failure in 56 patients (71.8%) and hepatic recurrence in 48 (61.5%), both accounting for 97% of the total recurrence rate. About 95% of recurrences occurred by 24 months after operation. Median disease-free survival time was 8 months, and cumulative 1-, 3-, and 5-year actuarial disease-free survival rates were 66%, 7%, and 3%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that tumor grade (p = 0.04), microscopic radicality of resection (p = 0.04), lymph node status (p = 0.01), and size of the tumor (p = 0.005) were independent predictors of disease-free survival. Patterns of failure and disease-free survival were not statistically influenced by the type of surgical procedure performed. Median survival time from the detection of recurrence until death was 7 months for local recurrence versus 3 months for hepatic or local plus hepatic recurrence (p < 0.05). From our experience and the data collected from the literature, it appears that surgery alone is an inadequate treatment for cure in patients with pancreatic carcinoma. Effective adjuvant therapies are needed to improve locoregional control of pancreatic cancer after surgical resection.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 33714027\nTitle: An integrated model of N6-methyladenosine regulators to predict tumor aggressiveness and immune evasion in pancreatic cancer.\nAuthors: Zhou Z, Zhang J, Xu C\nJournal: EBioMedicine\nPublication Date: 2021 Mar\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant mRNA modification. Whether m6A regulators can determine tumor aggressiveness and risk of immune evasion in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains unknown. METHODS: An integrated model named \"m6Ascore\" is constructed based on RNA-seq data of m6A regulators in PDAC. Association of m6Ascore and overall survival is validated across several different datasets. Overlaps of m6Ascore and established molecular classifications of PDAC is examined. Immune infiltration, enriched pathways, somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs), mutation profiles and response to immune checkpoint inhibitors are compared between m6Ascore-high and m6Ascore-low tumors. FINDINGS: m6Ascore is associated with dismal overall survival and increased tumor recurrence in PDAC as well as several other solid tumors including colorectal cancer and breast cancer. Basal-like (Squamous) PDAC has higher m6Ascore than that in the classical PDAC. Mechanism study showed m6Ascore-high tumors are characterized with reduced immune infiltration and T cells exhaustion. Meanwhile, m6Ascore is associated with genes regulating cachexia and chemoresistance in PDAC. Furthermore, distinct SCNAs patterns and mutation profiles of KRAS and TP53 are present in m6Ascore-high tumors, indicating immune evasion. m6Ascore-low tumors have higher response rates to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). INTERPRETATION: These findings indicate m6Ascore can predict aggressiveness and immune evasion in pancreatic cancer. This model has implications for pancreatic cancer prognosis and treatment response to ICIs. FUNDING: This work was supported in part by National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants to M.

However, the data are still controversial. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to summarize and compare the outcome of IPMC and PDAC after surgical resection. METHODS: Studies comparing IPMC and PDAC were identified using Medline and Embase search engines. Primary outcomes of interest were survival and recurrence. Secondary outcomes were clinicopathological characteristics. Meta-analysis of data was conducted using a random-effects model. RESULTS: A total of 14 studies were included. Pooled analysis revealed an improved 5-year overall survival (OS) for IPMC compared to PDAC (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.09-0.56). Both colloid and tubular IPMC showed improved 5-year OS compared to PDAC (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.05-0.25 and OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.26-0.54, respectively). Median survival time ranged from 21 to 58 months in the IPMC group compared to 12-23 months in the PDAC group. No meta-analysis could be performed on recurrence or on time-to-event data. Descriptive data showed no survival difference for higher TNM stages. IPMC was more often found at a TNM-stage of 1 (OR 4.40, 95% CI 2.71-7.15) and had lower rates of lymph node spread (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.32-0.57). CONCLUSION: Available data suggest that IPMC has a more indolent course with a better 5-year OS compared to PDAC. The histopathological features are less aggressive in IPMC. The reason may be earlier detection. However, for IPMC with higher TNM stages the survival seems to be similar to that of PDAC.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nCapecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers. Capecitabine is a prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to fluorouracil (antimetabolite) in the tumor, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor tissue.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

In this study, we identified prognostic factors for survival and recurrence in patients with histologically proven pancreatic adenocarcinoma. METHODOLOGY: Between January 2003 and December 2009, 82 patients with histologically proven pancreatic adenocarcinoma were considered for this study. Follow-up consisted of personal contact with patients or review of electronic medical records at this center and was terminated on December 31, 2011 or upon the patient's death. RESULTS: Overall survival rates of all patients at 1, 3, and 5 years were 51.9, 21.6 and 16.0%. Preoperative jaundice was the only independent prognostic factor for total pancreatic cancer patients, while N stage and perineural invasion in pathological findings was identified as an independent prognostic factor for survival of patients with surgical resection. Chemotherapy was the only independent prognostic factor for survival of patients who underwent palliative surgical bypass. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative jaundice in any patients, lymph node metastasis, perineural invasion in patients with surgical resection, and chemotherapy in patients undergoing palliative surgical bypass are important prognostic factors for survival of pancreatic cancer.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 37185395\nTitle: Early Recurrence after Upfront Surgery for Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Nappo G, Donisi G, Capretti G\nJournal: Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)\nPublication Date: 2023 Mar 27\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Survival after surgery for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains poor, due to early recurrence (ER) of the disease. A global definition of ER is lacking and different cut-off values (6, 8, and 12 months) have been adopted. The aims of this study were to define the optimal cut-off for the definition of ER and predictive factors for ER. METHODS: Recurrence was recorded for all consecutive patients undergoing upfront surgery for PDAC at our institute between 2010 and 2017. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were utilized, to estimate the optimal cut-off for the definition of ER as a predictive factor for poor post-progression survival (PPS). To identify predictive factors of ER, univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used. RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty one cases were retrospectively evaluated. The recurrence rate was 76.9%. ER rates were 29.0%, 37.6%, and 47.6%, when adopting 6, 8, and 12 months as cut-offs, respectively. A significant difference in median PPS was only shown between ER and late recurrence using 12 months as cut-off (p = 0.005). In the multivariate analysis, a pre-operative value of CA 19-9 > 70.5 UI/L (OR 3.10 (1.41-6.81); p = 0.005) and the omission of adjuvant treatment (OR 0.18 (0.08-0.41); p < 0.001) were significant predictive factors of ER. CONCLUSIONS: A twelve-months cut-off should be adopted for the definition of ER. Almost 50% of upfront-resected patients presented ER, and it significantly affected the prognosis. A high preoperative value of CA 19-9 and the omission of adjuvant treatment were the only predictive factors for ER.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 30945087\nTitle: Clinicopathological Features, Recurrence Patterns, and Prognosis of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma with Normal Serum CA19-9. A Consecutive Series of 154 Cases from a Single Institute.\nAuthors: Zhao Y, Wang C\nJournal: Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract\nPublication Date: 2020 Apr\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Serum levels of CA19-9 correlate with recurrence and survival in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma; however, little is known about the features and prognosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma with normal CA19-9 levels. METHOD: Patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (n = 806) were split into two groups with normal (</= 37 U/mL) and elevated (> 37 U/mL) CA19-9. The clinicopathological features, survival, and recurrence patterns were compared between two groups. We also sought to identify factors that best predicted prognosis in pancreatic adenocarcinoma with normal CA19-9 levels, to assist in the selection of the most effective adjuvant treatment. RESULTS: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma with normal CA19-9 were less likely to have lymph node metastasis, angiolymphatic invasion, intrapancreatic neural invasion, anterior serosal invasion, and invasion of the surrounding tissue/organ (distal bile duct, duodenum, or splenic artery or vein). Following propensity-score matching, pancreatic adenocarcinoma with normal CA19-9 levels (</= 37 U/ml) were associated with significantly superior overall survival following resection. Moreover, the CA19-9 </= 37 U/mL group demonstrated a significantly lower rate of local recurrence (35.57% vs. 52.35%, p = 0.004), distant recurrence (42.95% vs. 60.4%, p = 0.003), and mixed recurrence (5.37% vs. 29.53%, p < 0.000) compared with the CA19-9 > 37 U/mL group. Multivariate analysis suggested that angiolymphatic invasion, lymph node metastases, and tumor size > 3 cm were independent prognostic factors for pancreatic adenocarcinoma with normal CA19-9. Survival analyses suggested that post-op chemoradiotherapy or chemotherapy were associated with more favorable outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma with normal pretreatment CA19-9 levels (</= 37 U/ml) were characterized by better biological characteristics, reduced rates of recurrence, and longer overall survival. Moreover, optimal adjuvant therapy should be performed after surgery.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
