Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0035737-T01-IM6\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0035737\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Pancreatic Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Pancreas\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT468\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 776, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 60.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"PAAD\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

This study determines predictors of long-term (>5 years) disease-free survival and recurrence in adenocarcinoma arising from intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and derives a prognostic model for disease-free survival. METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent pancreatic resection for adenocarcinoma arising from intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms in 18 academic pancreatic centers in Europe and Asia between 2010 to 2017 with at least 5-year follow-up were identified. Factors associated with disease-free survival were determined using Cox proportional hazards model. Internal validation was performed, and discrimination and calibration indices were assessed. RESULTS: In the study, 288 patients (median age, 70 years; 52% male) were identified; 140 (48%) patients developed recurrence after a median follow-up of 98 months (interquartile range, 78.4-123), 57 patients (19.8%) developed locoregional recurrence, and 109 patients (37.8%) systemic recurrence. At 5 years after resection, the overall and disease-free survival was 46.5% (134/288) and 35.0% (101/288), respectively. On Cox proportional hazards model analysis, multivisceral resection (hazard ratio, 2.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-4.60), pancreatic tail location (hazard ratio, 2.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.22-4.50), poor tumor differentiation (hazard ratio, 2.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-5.30), lymphovascular invasion (hazard ratio, 1.74; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-2.88), and perineural invasion (hazard ratio, 1.83; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-3.10) were negatively associated with long-term disease-free survival. The final predictive model incorporated 8 predictors and demonstrated good predictive ability for disease-free survival (C-index, 0.74; calibration, slope 1.00). CONCLUSION: A third of patients achieve long-term disease-free survival (>5 years) after pancreatic resection for adenocarcinoma arising from intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms. The predictive model developed in the current study can be used to estimate the probability of long-term disease-free survival.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 38961040\nTitle: Precursor Epithelial Subtypes of Adenocarcinoma Arising from Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms (A-IPMN): Clinicopathological Features, Recurrence and Response to Adjuvant Chemotherapy.\nAuthors: Lucocq J, Haugk B, Parkinson D\nJournal: Annals of surgical oncology\nPublication Date: 2024 Oct\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: The clinico-oncological outcomes of precursor epithelial subtypes of adenocarcinoma arising from intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (A-IPMN) are limited to small cohort studies. Differences in recurrence patterns and response to adjuvant chemotherapy between A-IPMN subtypes are unknown. METHODS: Clincopathological features, recurrence patterns and long-term outcomes of patients undergoing pancreatic resection (2010-2020) for A-IPMN were reported from 18 academic pancreatic centres worldwide. Precursor epithelial subtype groups were compared using uni- and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: In total, 297 patients were included (median age, 70 years; male, 78.9%), including 54 (18.2%) gastric, 111 (37.3%) pancreatobiliary, 80 (26.9%) intestinal and 52 (17.5%) mixed subtypes. Gastric, pancreaticobiliary and mixed subtypes had comparable clinicopathological features, yet the outcomes were significantly less favourable than the intestinal subtype. The median time to recurrence in gastric, pancreatobiliary, intestinal and mixed subtypes were 32, 30, 61 and 33 months. Gastric and pancreatobiliary subtypes had worse overall recurrence (p = 0.048 and p = 0.049, respectively) compared with the intestinal subtype but gastric and pancreatobiliary subtypes had comparable outcomes. Adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with improved survival in the pancreatobiliary subtype (p = 0.049) but not gastric (p = 0.992), intestinal (p = 0.852) or mixed subtypes (p = 0.723). In multivariate survival analysis, adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with a lower likelihood of death in pancreatobiliary subtype, albeit with borderline significance [hazard ratio (HR) 0.56; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31-1.01; p = 0.058]. CONCLUSIONS: Gastric, pancreatobiliary and mixed subtypes have comparable recurrence and survival outcomes, which are inferior to the more indolent intestinal subtype. Pancreatobiliary subtype may respond to adjuvant chemotherapy and further research is warranted to determine the most appropriate adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for each subtype.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 19137380\nTitle: Vascular resection in pancreatic cancer surgery: survival determinants.\nAuthors: Muller SA, Hartel M, Mehrabi A\nJournal: Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract\nPublication Date: 2009 Apr\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION: Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is the standard operation for cancer of the pancreatic head. To achieve complete tumor resection and, thus, improve long-term survival, venous resection of the portal or superior mesenteric vein with reconstruction has become routine for advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, its clinical benefit still remains controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate morbidity, mortality, and survival of patients with advanced PDAC following PD with venous resection and to identify significant survival determinants. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From October 2001 to December 2007, 488 patients with PDAC of the pancreatic head underwent PD at our department. Venous resection was performed in 110 patients (22.5%). Clinical data, surgical techniques, perioperative parameters, and histopathologic data were analyzed on a prospective database. RESULTS: Major venous reconstruction was accomplished through primary lateral venorrhaphy in 18 patients (16.3%), polytetrafluoroethylene grafting (n = 14, 12.7%), primary end-to-end anastomosis (n = 72, 65.5%), an autologous saphenous venous graft patch (n = 4, 4.6%) or a Goretex(R) patch (n = 2, 2.3%). In 78.1% histopathologic examination revealed cancer invasion of the vein, whereas the remainder had peritumoral inflammation extending to the vessel wall. Perioperative morbidity rate was 41.8%; and the mortality rate 3.6%. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates were 55.2%, 23.1%, and 14.4%, respectively. Operating time (>420 min) and advanced age (>70 years) were the only prognostic variables, which significantly diminished survival on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Resection of the superior mesenteric or portal vein to achieve macroscopic tumor clearance can be performed safely with acceptable operative morbidity and mortality. However, improved local clearance in these patients cannot achieve a favorable long-term survival for all patients because distant metastases or local recurrence is frequent.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Older adults are under-represented in clinical trials and their care is complicated with multiple age-related conditions. Research suggests that older patients can experience meaningful responses to treatment for PDAC. The objective of this study was to evaluate the characteristics, rate of treatment, and survival outcomes of patients with metastatic PDAC (mPDAC) based on age at diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were extracted for patients diagnosed with mPDAC between January 1, 2015, and March 31, 2020, from the Flatiron Health database. Patients were stratified into 3 age groups: <70 years old, 70-79 years, and >/=80 years. The proportion of patients who received first-line therapy, the types of regimens received in the metastatic setting, overall survival (OS) from the start of treatment were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 8382 patients included, 71.3% (n = 5973) received treatment. Among patients who received treatment 55.5% (n = 3313) were aged <70 years at diagnosis, 33.0% (n = 1972) were 70-79 years, and 11.5% (n = 688) were >/=80 years. Patients >/=80 years of age were more likely to receive gemcitabine monotherapy and less likely to receive FOLFIRINOX. Among first-line treated patients, median OS significantly decreased with age. However, when comparing patients treated with the same first-line regimen, no significant differences in median OS were observed by age. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights that older adults with mPDAC can benefit substantially by receiving appropriate levels of treatment.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 38462860\nTitle: The Effect of Age on Pancreaticoduodenectomy; Comorbidities, Short-term Outcomes, and Survival.\nAuthors: Ozdemir U, Ulas M, Ekici B\nJournal: Journal of the College of Physicians and Surgeons--Pakistan : JCPSP\nPublication Date: 2024 Mar\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the complications, mortality, and survival rates of patients aged >70 years undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy, and to determine associated risk factors. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive study. Place and Duration of the Study: General Surgery Clinic of Eskisehir Osmangazi University Medical Faculty Hospital, Eskisehir, Turkiye, from January 2014 to September 2020. METHODOLOGY: A retrospective scrutiny of 94 patients who had undergone pancreaticodueodenectomy, was carried out. The patients were separated into two age groups of younger and older than 70 years, and were compared in respect of clinicopathological characteristics, comorbidities, perioperative characteristics, and complications. Independent risk factors for the endpoints of perioperative mortality and survival were investigated. RESULTS: No significant difference was determined between the groups in respect of biochemical values, and perioperative and histochemical characteristics. Comorbidities were present at a higher rate in the older patients (77.8% vs. 38.8%, p<0.001). The postoperative complication rates were similar (33.3% vs. 32.7%, p=0.944). Perioperative mortality (first 30 days) was determined at a significantly higher rate in the older age group (20.0% vs. 4.1%, p=0.016). The age of patients >70 years increased the risk of mortality 4.851-fold but was not an independent predictive factor (p=0.086). The groups were similar in respect of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS, Log-rank p=0.780, p=0.386). Age [Hazard Ratio (HR): 1.029, p=0.048] and pancreas adenocarcinoma (HR: 1.846, p=0.028) were determined to be independent prognostic factors for DFS, and pancreas adenocarcinoma (HR 1.940, p=0.023) for OS. CONCLUSION: Older age was not seen to change survival in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy, but mortality within the first 30 days was affected. Age is not accepted as an absolute contraindication. It is recommended that pancreaticoduodenectomy is performed on patients aged >70 years with careful patient selection, prudent preoperative preparation, a meticulous surgical technique, and close multidisciplinary postoperative support. KEY WORDS: Pancreaticoduodenectomy, Elderly, Comorbidity, Complication, Mortality, Survival.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 25721397\nTitle: Factors influencing survival after pancreatoduodenectomy for ductal adenocarcinoma depend on patients' age.\nAuthors: Urbonas K, Gulbinas A, Smailyte G\nJournal: Digestive surgery\nPublication Date: 2015\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: It is supposed that a prolonged lifetime will be associated with increased incidence of PDAC among the elderly. Some studies show a tendency toward decreased survival in the elderly patients following pancreatoduodenectomy for PDAC. The aim of this study was to evaluate factors, influencing survival following pancreatoduodenectomy for PDAC in different age groups. METHODS: Data of 251 patients after pancreatoduodenectomy for PDAC between 1999 and 2012 were analyzed. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used to calculate survival and to compare differences between groups. The Cox proportional hazard model was applied to indentify independent prognosticators. RESULTS: The overall median survival was 14.9 months. Postoperative morbidity was 25.5% with a 5.1% mortality rate. No significant differences in the overall morbidity (22.4 vs. 29.6%) or mortality (2.8 vs. 8.3%) rates were observed between different patients' age groups (<70 years and >70 years). Multivariate analysis revealed R1 resection (HR 1.76) and poor tumor differentiation (G3-G4) (HR 1.48) were independent negative factors for survival in patients <70 years. Lymph-node metastases (N1) - HR 4.89 and perineural invasion - HR 2.73 were independent prognosticators in the elderly. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlighted different factors influencing long-term survival after pancreatoduodenectomy: R1 resection and poor tumor differentiation (G3-G4) were independent negative factors for survival in patients <70 years, while perineural invasion and lymph-node metastases result in worse survival among the elderly.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
