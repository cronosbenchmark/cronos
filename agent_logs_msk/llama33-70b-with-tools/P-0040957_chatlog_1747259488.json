Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

METHODS: The authors reviewed all patients in their Tumor Registry with Stage II and Stage III adenocarcinoma of the colon who underwent potentially curative resection for their disease at the Geisinger Medical Center between January 1990 and September 2000. One hundred twenty patients underwent complete resection of their colon carcinoma and received 5-fluorouracil-based (5-FU) adjuvant chemotherapy. RESULTS: The 5-year disease free survival rate for patients age > or =65 years (Group A) was 70% compared with 56% for patients age < 65 years (Group B) (P = 0.085). The 5-year overall survival rate for patients in Group B was 77% compared with 62% for the patients in Group A (P = 0.143). In a Cox regression model, age was not a predictor of disease free survival (P = 0.633) or overall survival (P = 0.900) when it was analyzed as a continuous variable. Only 19 patients were age > 75 years, and the disease free and overall survival rates for this group were similar but were underpowered compared with the rates for the patients ages between 65-75 years. When gender and disease stage were included in the model, age remained a nonsignificant variable (P = 0.400 for disease free survival; P = 0.615 for overall survival). Nine of 56 patients in Group A (16%) experienced Grade 3-4 toxicity compared with 14 of 64 patients in Group B (22%) (P = 0.420). The lack of a correlation between toxicity and age was maintained after controlling for disease stage and patient gender (P = 0.343). There were no correlations between preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen level, tumor grade, or lymph node involvement and patient age (P = 0.258, P = 0.256, and P = 0.519, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients with Stage II and Stage III colon carcinoma benefit from 5-FU-based adjuvant therapy without a significant increase in toxicity compared with their younger counterparts. Adjuvant chemotherapy should be presented to elderly patients with high-risk, resected colon carcinoma. The data regarding age cannot be generalized to patients age > 75 years.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 37395810\nTitle: Robotic versus laparoscopic colectomy outcomes in colon adenocarcinoma in the elderly population: a propensity-score matched analysis of the National Cancer Database.\nAuthors: Pacheco F, Harris-Gendron S, Luciano E\nJournal: International journal of colorectal disease\nPublication Date: 2023 Jul 3\nAbstract: PURPOSE: While robotic surgery is more costly and involves longer intra-operative time, it has a technical advantage over laparoscopic surgery. With our aging population, patients are being diagnosed with colon cancer at older ages. The aim of this study is to compare laparoscopic versus robotic colectomy short- and long-term outcomes in elderly patients diagnosed with colon cancer at a national level. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted using the National Cancer Database. Subjects >/= 80-years-old who were diagnosed with stage I to III colon adenocarcinoma and underwent a robotic or laparoscopic colectomy from 2010-2018 were included. The laparoscopic group was propensity-score matched in a 3:1 ratio to the robotic group with 9343 laparoscopic and 3116 robotic cases matched. The main outcomes evaluated were 30-day mortality, 30-day readmission rate, median survival, and length of stay. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the 30-day readmission rate (OR = 1.1, CI = 0.94-1.29, p = 0.23) or 30-day mortality rate (OR = 1.05, CI = 0.86-1.28, p = 0.63) between both groups. Robotic surgery was associated with higher overall survival (42 vs 44.7 months, p < 0.001) using a Kaplan-Meier survival curve. Robotic surgery had a statistically significant shorter length of stay (6.4 vs. 5.9 days, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Robotic colectomies are associated with higher median survival rates and decrease in the length of hospital stay compared to laparoscopic colectomies in the elderly population.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 31250557\nTitle: Single-port laparoscopic colectomy in elderly patients with colon cancer: A propensity score-matched comparison with younger patients.\nAuthors: Hirano Y, Hiranuma C, Hattori M\nJournal: Asian journal of endoscopic surgery\nPublication Date: 2020 Apr\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION: This study aims to evaluate the safety and feasibility of single-port laparoscopic colectomy (SPLC) in elderly patients with colon cancer. METHODS: During the study period, 344 patients underwent SPLC in our hospital. Among them, 87 patients were aged 80 years and older, and 257 patients were younger than 80 years. After 1:1 propensity-score matching, 87 elderly patients were compared with 87 young patients. RESULTS: Short-term clinical outcomes after SPLC were equivalent between the two groups, although the elderly group had a higher ASA score and more postoperative complications. The 5-year overall survival rates were 64.6% in the elderly group and 66.8% in control group. The 5-year cancer-specific survival rates were 78.0% in the elderly group and 70.9% in control group. There were no significant differences between the groups. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that SPLC is technically feasible for operative teams that have adequately standardized the procedure, and it is oncologically safe in elderly patients with colon cancer.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

The patient's CEA levels have been increasing over time, with a recent value of 329.5 ng/ml, indicating a poor response to treatment.\n\nThe patient has undergone multiple CT scans and MRIs, which have revealed cancer progression and metastasis to the lung and liver. The patient's cancer has been classified as stage IV, and the patient has been treated with multiple lines of chemotherapy.\n\nGiven the patient's poor response to treatment, increasing CEA levels, and metastasis to the lung and liver, the prognosis is poor. The patient's life expectancy is likely limited.\n\n[ANSWER: B]"
