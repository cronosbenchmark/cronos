It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nCapecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers.

Data are also lacking for KRAS submutations and prognosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined clinicopathological variables and prognosis in patients with surgically resected stage III CC who participated in seven clinical trials from the ACCENT/IDEA databases. Associations between KRAS exon 2 and BRAF(V600E) mutations and time to recurrence (TTR), overall survival (OS), and survival after recurrence (SAR) were assessed using a Cox model. We also analyzed the prognostic value of KRAS exon 2 submutations. RESULTS: Among 8460 patients, 11.4% had MSI-H status. In the MSI-H group, BRAF(V600E), KRAS exon 2 mutants, and double-wild-type statuses were detected in 40.6%, 18.1%, and 41.3%, respectively, whereas and in the microsatellite stable (MSS) group, these were detected in 7.7%, 38.6%, and 53.8%, respectively. In the MSS group, 5-year TTR rates of 61.8%, 66.3%, and 72.9% were observed among patients with BRAF(V600E), KRAS exon 2 mutants, and those who were DWT, respectively [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 1.58 and 1.31, both P < 0.001]. In the MSI-H group, 5-year TTR rates did not differ significantly among the mutated subgroups. Similar results were found for OS. However, survival after relapse was significantly shorter in the KRAS exon 2- and BRAF(V600E)-mutated patients in both MSS (adjusted HR = 2.06 and 1.15; both P < 0.05) and MSI-H (adjusted HR = 1.99 and 1.81; both P < 0.05) groups. In the MSS group, KRAS exon 2 mutations were associated with TTR, but only p.G12C, p.G12D, and p.G13D were associated with poor outcomes after disease recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Testing for both KRAS and BRAF(V600E) mutations in stage III patients should be considered as they can better define individual patient prognosis, and may also enable patient selection for (neo)adjuvant trials dedicated to specific molecular subtypes with poor prognosis.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Methods: The clinicopathologic and prognostic data of 278 patients with sporadic, synchronous, multiple, primary, colorectal carcinomas who had been admitted to the Department of Colorectal Surgery at Zhejiang Cancer Hospital from January 2008 to July 2022 were retrospectively collected. The patients were categorized into three groups based on the relative locations of their multiple cancer foci: (1) a right-sided group that comprised patients with multiple cancer foci in the cecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure of the colon, and transverse colon; (2) a left-sided group that comprised patients with multiple cancer foci in the splenic flexure of the colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum; and (3) a left- and right-sided group that comprised patients with multiple cancer foci in the right half of the colon and left half of the colon/rectum. Additionally, the patients were further divided into two groups based on microsatellite status: a high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) and a low MSI/stable MSI (MSI/L&MSS) group. We compared differences in clinical characteristics and prognostic indicators between these groups. The chi(2) test was utilized to compare selected clinical characteristics, whereas Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and log-rank tests were performed to compare their effects on prognosis. Result: Among 278 patients with SSCRC, 256 (92.1%) presented with two cancer foci and 22 (7.9%) with more than two foci. Additionally, 255 patients (91.7%) had adenocarcinomas, whereas the remaining 23 (8.3%) had mucinous adenocarcinomas. Lymph node metastases were identified in 136 patients (48.9%); the cancer foci had infiltrated beyond the muscular layer in 238 (85.6%); and 147 patients (52.9%) were diagnosed with TNM Stage III-IV disease. There were 155 patients (55.8%) in the left-sided group, 55 (19.8%) in the right-sided group, and 68 (24.5%) in the left- and right-sided group. Immunohistochemical examination of all four mismatch repair proteins were performed in 199 cases, revealing that 166 of these patients had MSI/L&MSS and 33 MSI-H disease. In the left-sided, left- and right-sided, and right-sided groups, the proportion of women was 16.8% (26/155), 26.5% (18/68), and 49.1% (27/55), respectively; these differences are statistically significant (chi(2)=22.335, P<0.001). The proportions of patients with more than three cancer foci were 5.2% (8/155), 16.2% (11/68), and 5.5% (3/55), respectively; these differences are statistically significant (chi(2)=8.438, P=0.015). The proportions of mucinous adenocarcinomas were 4.5% (7/155), 8.8% (6/68), and 18.2% (10/55), respectively; these differences are statistically significant (chi(2)=10.026, P=0.007). The proportions of patients with lymph node metastases were 55.5% (86/155), 48.5% (33/68), and 30.9% (17/55); these differences are statistically significant (chi(2)=9.817, P=0.007). The proportions of patients with Stage T3 & T4 disease in each group according to location were 81.3% (126/155), 88.2% (60/68), and 94.5% (52/55), respectively; these differences are statistically significant (chi(2)=6.293,P=0.043). The proportions of TNM Stage III-IV tumors were 59.4% (92/155), 54.4% (37/68), and 32.7% (18/55), respectively; these differences are statistically significant (chi(2)=11.637, P=0.003). Age, size of cancer foci, presence of distant metastasis, adenoma, nerve invasion, and vascular invasion did not differ significantly between the three groups (all P>0.05). Compared with those with MSI-H, patients with MSI/L&MSS disease were more likely to be aged >65 years and male (50.6% [84/166] vs. 15.2% [5/33], chi(2)=13.994,P<0.001; 80.7% [134/166] vs. 54.5% [18/33], chi(2)=10.457,P=0.001), more likely to be in the left-sided group (63.3% [105/166] vs. 24.2% [8/33], chi(2)=18.232, P<0.001), had a higher proportion of cancer foci of diameter <4 cm (54.8% [91/166] vs. 33.3% [11/33], chi(2)=5.086,P=0.024), and a lower proportion of mucinous adenocarcinomas (4.2% [7/166] vs. 27.3% [9/33], chi(2)=19.791,P<0.001), more likely to develop distant metastases (22.3% [37/166] vs. 6.1% [2/33], chi(2)=4.601,P=0.032), more likely to have lymph node metastases (57.2% [95/166) vs. 24.2% [8/33], chi(2)=11.996,P<0.001) and nerve invasion (28.9% [48/166] vs. 6.1% [2/33], chi(2)=7.643, P=0.006), had a higher proportion of TNM Stage III-IV disease (60.2% [100/166] vs. 24.2% [8/33], chi(2)=14.374, P<0.001), and a smaller proportion of family history of tumors (28.9% [48/166] vs. 60.6% [20/33], chi(2)=12.228, P<0.001). All the above-listed differences are statistically significant (all P<0.05). The differences in number of cancer foci, depth of infiltration, presence or absence of adenomas, and vascular invasion were not statistically significant (all P>0.05). In the 33 patients with MSI-H status and mismatch repair protein loss, the highest frequency of deletion was found in PMS-2 (66.7%, 22/33), followed by MLH-1 (57.6%, 19/33), whereas the proportions of MSH-2 (33.3%, 11/33) and MSH-6 (24.2%, 8/33) deletions were relatively low. There were statistically significant differences in the 3-year overall survival rates among the groups according to relative locations of cancer foci. The 3-year overall survival rates were 96.8%, 79.6%, and 88.5% in the right-sided, left- and right-sided, and left-sided groups, respectively (P=0.021). As to microsatellite status, the 3-year overall survival rate of patients with MSI-H disease was 93.8%, which is significantly better than the 78.4% for those with MSI/L & MSS (P=0.026). Conclusions: Among sporadic, synchronous, multiple, primary, colorectal carcinomas, those with right-sided disease had the deepest local infiltration, whereas those with left-sided disease had the greatest number of lymph node metastases, most advanced clinical TNM stage, lowest percentage of MSI-H disease, and the poorest prognosis.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 37619846\nTitle: Different prognostic values of KRAS exon 2 submutations and BRAF V600E mutation in microsatellite stable (MSS) and unstable (MSI) stage III colon cancer: an ACCENT/IDEA pooled analysis of seven trials.\nAuthors: Taieb J, Sinicrope FA, Pederson L\nJournal: Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology\nPublication Date: 2023 Nov\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: The prognostic value of KRAS and BRAF(V600E) mutations in stage III colon cancer (CC) remains controversial and has never been clearly analyzed in patients with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors due to sample size limitations. Data are also lacking for KRAS submutations and prognosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined clinicopathological variables and prognosis in patients with surgically resected stage III CC who participated in seven clinical trials from the ACCENT/IDEA databases. Associations between KRAS exon 2 and BRAF(V600E) mutations and time to recurrence (TTR), overall survival (OS), and survival after recurrence (SAR) were assessed using a Cox model. We also analyzed the prognostic value of KRAS exon 2 submutations. RESULTS: Among 8460 patients, 11.4% had MSI-H status. In the MSI-H group, BRAF(V600E), KRAS exon 2 mutants, and double-wild-type statuses were detected in 40.6%, 18.1%, and 41.3%, respectively, whereas and in the microsatellite stable (MSS) group, these were detected in 7.7%, 38.6%, and 53.8%, respectively. In the MSS group, 5-year TTR rates of 61.8%, 66.3%, and 72.9% were observed among patients with BRAF(V600E), KRAS exon 2 mutants, and those who were DWT, respectively [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 1.58 and 1.31, both P < 0.001]. In the MSI-H group, 5-year TTR rates did not differ significantly among the mutated subgroups. Similar results were found for OS. However, survival after relapse was significantly shorter in the KRAS exon 2- and BRAF(V600E)-mutated patients in both MSS (adjusted HR = 2.06 and 1.15; both P < 0.05) and MSI-H (adjusted HR = 1.99 and 1.81; both P < 0.05) groups. In the MSS group, KRAS exon 2 mutations were associated with TTR, but only p.G12C, p.G12D, and p.G13D were associated with poor outcomes after disease recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Testing for both KRAS and BRAF(V600E) mutations in stage III patients should be considered as they can better define individual patient prognosis, and may also enable patient selection for (neo)adjuvant trials dedicated to specific molecular subtypes with poor prognosis.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
