In our hospital, we continuously administer chemotherapy after the completion of chemoradiotherapy, until 2 weeks before surgery for most patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective study. Patients received a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the rectum at our hospital between January 2003 and December 2008 and received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and curative surgery. Chemoradiotherapy consisted of continuous infusion of 225 mg/m(2) 5-fluorouracil, 5 days per week. Radiation therapy was delivered at 1.8 Gy per day, 5 days per week for 5-6 weeks (median radiation dose, 50.4 Gy). Chemotherapy was continued until 2 weeks before surgery, and surgery was performed 6-8 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy. RESULTS: The study included 119 patients (median age, 61 years; range, 24-84 years). Twenty-nine patients (24.4%) had a complete response and 65 (54.6%) had a partial response. Over a median follow-up duration of 52 months, 10 patients experienced local recurrence and 18 had distant metastasis. The 5-year overall and disease-free survival rates were 80.6% and 72.9%, respectively. Grade 3-4 toxicity only occurred in 14 patients (11.8%). CONCLUSION: Continued chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil after completing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy until 2 weeks before surgery for locally advanced rectal cancer results in a good pathological control rate, with low toxicity. Patients who achieved a complete pathological response had a better long-term oncological outcome than those who did not.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 23389353\nTitle: Neoadjuvant therapy and mini-invasive total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer: feasibility and outcome analysis from a single institution prospectively collected data base.\nAuthors: Grosso F, Mandala M, Maglione V\nJournal: Tumori\nPublication Date: 2012 Nov\nAbstract: AIM AND BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant treatment for rectal adenocarcinoma improves local control and represents the standard for locally advanced disease. Laparoscopic and robotic total mesorectal excision has been increasingly adopted. It provides magnified visualization of the pelvic cavity, thereby facilitating the mesorectal dissection. METHODS: Consecutive patients with locally advanced/ultralow rectal adenocarcinoma received neoadjuvant treatment and mini-invasive total mesorectal excision at our center. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records by using a prospectively collected data base and focusing on feasibility, tumor response and treatment outcomes. RESULTS: In a 13-year period, 117 rectal adenocarcinoma patients (80 males and 37 females) received neoadjuvant treatment and mini-invasive total mesorectal excision. Median age at diagnosis was 67 years; pre-treatment stage was I in 10 (9%); IIA in 58 (50%); IIC in 5 (4%); IIIA in 10 (9%); IIIB in 31 (26%) and IV in 3 (2%) patients. All patients received external beam radiation therapy, 79 (67%) combined with fluorouracil-based chemotherapy. One-hundred and three patients underwent laparoscopic surgery and 14 robotic surgery. Overall, 90 patients (77%) had anterior resection and 27 (23%) had abdominoperineal resection. Down-staging was obtained in 70 patients (66%). No major intraoperative nor delayed surgical complications were observed. At a median follow up of 52 months, 8 patients (7%) had a local relapse, 7 of them along with distant relapse, and 16 (14%) had distant relapse. The 5-year relapse-free survival was 76.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that in a community hospital mini-invasive surgery after neoadjuvant treatment is feasible in real clinical practice and achieves consistent results in term of disease control rate.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 40286473\nTitle: Short-course radiation followed by mFOLFOX-6 plus avelumab for locally-advanced microsatellite stable rectal adenocarcinoma: The Averectal study.\nAuthors: Shamseddine A, Turfa R, Chehade L\nJournal: European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)\nPublication Date: 2025 Apr 22\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Total neoadjuvant therapy(TNT) has improved complete pathologic response (pCR) rate and disease-free survival (DFS) in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC), though an increased local recurrence rate (LRR) with short-course radiotherapy (SCRT) is concerning. Synergism between immunotherapy and radiotherapy may improve outcomes in LARC, even where microsatellite stable (MSS) tumours exist. The Averectal trial evaluated SCRT, followed by chemotherapy and immunotherapy with avelumab and total mesorectal excision (TME) in these patients. METHODS: Patients with LARC received SCRT (5\u202fGy x5 fractions), 6 cycles of mFOLFOX-6 plus avelumab every 2 weeks, followed by TME in an investigator-initiated, open-label, single-arm, multicentre, phase II study. The primary outcome was pCR vs. historical control. Secondary outcomes were 3-year DFS, local recurrence rate (LR) and the association of the ImmunoScore (IS) with outcomes including pCR, safety, and quality of life (QoL). RESULTS: Out Of 44 MSS patients enrolled from 3 centres (July 2018\u202f-October 2020), 40 completed treatment and analysed (65\u202f% male, median age 58.5 [31.0, 74.0] years). Median follow-up was 44 months (11.4, 51.4). Fifteen patients (37.5\u202f%) achieved pCR; and 67.5\u202f% had a major pathologic response. Mean DFS was 42 months (37.9, 46.1). Mean OS was 46.3 months (44.4, 48.2). Median DFS and OS were not reached. Three-year DFS was 85\u202f%. LRR was 2.5\u202f%. Patients with vs. without pCR had higher mean IS (68 vs. 52, p\u202f=\u202f0.036). Serious adverse events occurred in 23.5\u202f% (one was related to avelumab). Three patients died (7.5\u202f%), due to disease progression. QOL was similar between baseline and last follow-up. CONCLUSION: Adding avelumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy mFOLFOX6 after SCRT, followed by TME, improved pCR without increasing LRR, with acceptable toxicity and QOL.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Article #3 introduces the Averectal study, which evaluated short-course radiation followed by mFOLFOX-6 plus avelumab for locally-advanced microsatellite stable rectal adenocarcinoma, showing improved complete pathologic response rates and disease-free survival without increasing local recurrence rates.\n\nConsidering the patient's age (52 years old) and the fact that they have undergone chemotherapy with Gemcitabine and Cisplatin, as well as the general trends and outcomes presented in the PubMed articles, it is reasonable to assume that the patient has a favorable prognosis regarding survival in the next 12 months. The patient's recent medical history, including the lack of evidence of cancer progression and the positive response to treatment, further supports this assumption.\n\n[ANSWER: A]"

We aimed to study treatment and outcomes of rectal cancer in the equal access Military Health System (MHS) to better understand potential racial disparities. METHODS: We accessed the MilCanEpi database to study a cohort of patients aged 18 and older who were diagnosed with rectal adenocarcinoma between 1998 and 2014. Receipt of guideline recommended treatment per tumor stage, cancer recurrence, and all-cause death were compared between non-Hispanic White and Black patients using multivariable regression models with associations expressed as odds (AORs) or hazard ratios (AHRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: The study included 171 Black and 845 White patients with rectal adenocarcinoma. Overall, there were no differences in receipt of guideline concordant treatment (AOR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.45 to 1.29), recurrence (AHR = 1.34, 95% CI = 0.85 to 2.12), or survival (AHR = 1.08, 95% CI = 0.77 to 1.54) for Black patients compared with White patients. However, Black patients younger than 50 years of age at diagnosis (AOR = 0.34, 95% CI = 0.13 to 0.90) or with stage III or IV tumors (AOR = 0.28, 95% CI = 0.12 to 0.64) were less likely to receive guideline recommended treatment than White patients in stratified analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In the equal access MHS, although there were no overall racial disparities in rectal cancer treatment or clinical outcomes between Black and White patients, disparities among those with early-onset or late-stage rectal cancers were noted. This suggests that factors other than access to care may play a role in the observed disparities and warrants further research.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 25889934\nTitle: Surgical management and outcome of rectal carcinoids in a university hospital.\nAuthors: Wei R, Lo OS, Law WL\nJournal: World journal of surgical oncology\nPublication Date: 2015 Feb 7\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Rectal carcinoids are an uncommon entity comprising only 1%-2% of all rectal tumors. Rectal carcinoids are frequently diagnosed during colonoscopy, but management after polypectomy is still controversial. The aims of this study were to review the surgical procedures for rectal carcinoids and to compare the outcomes of patients after different treatment modalities in a university hospital in Hong Kong. METHODS: All rectal carcinoids diagnosed between January 2003 and September 2012 were reviewed retrospectively, including clinicopathological characteristics, their management, and surgical outcomes. RESULTS: There were 54 patients with a median age of 60 years, and 32 were males (59.3%). All patients underwent colonoscopy, and the most had rectal bleeding (53.7%). Two patients were diagnosed incidentally in the surgical specimens of rectal tissues. Eighteen patients were diagnosed to have rectal carcinoids after snaring polypectomy, and no further intervention was required. Twenty-five patients had local resection either by means of transanal resection or transanal endoscopic operation. Radical resection was performed in seven patients in which one had T3N1 disease and the others did not have any lymph node metastasis. In the median follow-up of 30 months (10-108 months), there was no recurrence in the \"incidental\" or post-polypectomy group. However, two patients with transanal resection and two patients with radical resection developed hepatic metastases after 13-24 months post-treatment. The 5-year overall survival was 100% in patients having snaring polypectomy only, 83% for those with local resection, and 63% in patients who underwent radical surgery (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggested that that local resection was an effective treatment for small rectal carcinoids and generally brought about good oncological and surgical outcomes. For larger tumors, radical resection seemed to provide acceptable oncological outcomes. Regular surveillance with colonoscopy and endorectal ultrasound is highly recommended for high-risk patients for long-term management. By sharing our experience, we hope to provide more evidence on the management on rectal carcinoids which, together with evidence from further studies, may guide us in the long-term management of these patients in the future.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 15472410\nTitle: Patient profile and treatment outcome of rectal cancer patients treated with multimodality therapy at a regional cancer center.\nAuthors: Deo S, Kumar S, Shukla NK\nJournal: Indian journal of cancer\nPublication Date: 2004 Jul-Sep\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Incidence of rectal cancer has wide geographical variation. Disease pattern in developing countries is different from developed countries as majority of the patients present in advanced stage because of delayed referral and lack of uniform treatment practices. AIMS: Present study describes the patient profile and treatment results from a tertiary care cancer center in India. SETTING AND DESIGN: Tertiary care Regional cancer center. Retrospective analysis 89 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma treated between 1995 and 2002 were analyzed. METHODS: Patients with adenocarcinoma rectum were evaluated in a G.I. Oncology clinic and were treated using multimodality protocols involving surgery, radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: A descriptive analysis of patient and disease profile, treatment patterns and out come was performed. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Mean age of the patients was 45.4 years and majority of them had tumor in lower third of rectum with evidence of extrarectal spread. Seventy five percent of the patients underwent curative resection with abdominoperineal resection being the commonest procedure. Forty seven percent of patients were given short course preoperative radiotherapy and the remaining received postoperative radiotherapy. Sixty four percent of patients could complete planned adjuvant chemotherapy. Operative mortality was 2% and 23% had morbidity. Local recurrence rate was 8.9%. 5-year disease free and overall survival was 54% and 58% respectively. CONCLUSION: Majority of rectal cancer patients present with locally advanced and low rectal growths leading to low sphincter salvage rates. Despite the advanced stage of presentation optimal oncologic results can be obtained by using a good surgical techniques in combination with adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Short course preoperative radiotherapy seems to be more feasible in Indian context. Timely referral and uniform treatment guidelines throughout the country are needed for optimal management of rectal cancer in India.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

METHODS: This prospective study from the Norwegian Rectal Cancer Project includes all 2,283 patients younger than aged 70 years with adenocarcinoma of the rectum from November 1993 to December 1999. Patients younger than aged 40 years (n = 45), 40 to 44 years (n = 87), 45 to 49 years (n = 153), and 50 to 69 years (n = 1998) were compared for patient and tumor characteristics and five-year overall survival. Patients treated for cure (n = 1,354) were evaluated for local recurrence, distant metastasis, and disease-free survival. RESULTS: Patients younger than aged 40 years had significantly higher frequencies of poorly differentiated tumors (27 vs. 12-16 percent; P = 0.014), N2-stage (37 vs. 13-18 percent; P = 0.001), and distant metastases (38 vs. 19-24 percent; P = 0.019) compared with older patients. Among those treated for cure, 56 percent of the patients younger than aged 40 years developed distant metastases compared with 20 to 26 percent of the older patients (P = 0.003). Overall five-year survival was 54 percent for patients younger than aged 40 years compared with 71 to 88 percent for the older patients (P = 0.029). Age younger than 40 years was a significant independent prognostic factor and increased the risk for metastasis and death. CONCLUSIONS: Patients younger than aged 40 years had a more advanced stage at the time of diagnosis and poor prognosis compared with older patients. Young patients treated for cure more often developed distant metastases and had inferior survival.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 24798628\nTitle: Outcomes of rectal cancer treatment--influence of age?\nAuthors: Stornes T, Wibe A, Romundstad PR\nJournal: International journal of colorectal disease\nPublication Date: 2014 Jul\nAbstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate how age influences the selection to different treatment modalities for rectal cancer and how these differences in approach affect the short- and long-term outcomes. METHODS: A single-center cohort of all 837 rectal cancer patients diagnosed between 1994 and 2006 was analyzed. Patients <75, 75-79, 80-84, and >85 years were compared. RESULTS: Treatment for cure was judged possible for 80.8, 77.9, 74.6, and 65.3 % of the four age groups (p = 0.02), and radiochemotherapy was given to 22.9, 19.3, 10.2, and 2 % of the same groups (p = 0.001). Local resection was performed for 3.7, 14.7, 13.6, and 24.5 % (p < 0.001) and anterior resection for 66.6, 54.1, 56.8, and 49 % (p < 0.001). The 5-year rates of local recurrence were 5.3, 8.3, 12.8, and 22.3 % (p < 0.001), and overall survival was 70, 54, 45.9, and 29.8 % in the four groups treated with curative intent (p < 0.001). Relative survival was 76.4, 72.6, 72.9, and 72.3 % (ns). CONCLUSIONS: Age caused treatment to be modified; there was less surgery for patients over 85 years, less radiochemotherapy over 80 years, and less major radical surgery over 75 years. This strategy resulted in more local recurrences among the elderly, although no certain effect on relative survival was observed.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 25564165\nTitle: Early and Late Outcomes of Surgery for Locally Recurrent Rectal Cancer: A Prospective 10-Year Study in the Total Mesorectal Excision Era.\nAuthors: Nielsen M, Rasmussen P, Pedersen B\nJournal: Annals of surgical oncology\nPublication Date: 2015 Aug\nAbstract: AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the outcome of all locally recurrent rectal cancer (LRRC) patients who were referred to a tertiary care center. The study examined LRRC patients who underwent surgery after prior total mesorectal excision. METHOD: The data of 213 consecutive LRRC patients who were registered in a database between 2001 and 2010 were accessed. RESULTS: A total of 115 patients (54 %) with a median age of 63 (range 34-81) years underwent tumor resection. The 30-day mortality rate was 0.8 % (95 % CI 0.02-4 %), and the complication rate was 42 % (95 % CI 33-51 %). R0 resection was achieved in 70 patients (61 %), R1 resection in 38 patients (33 %), and R2 resection in 7 patients (6 %). The 3- and 5-year survival rates for R0 resections were 55 % (95 % CI 41-66) and 40 % (95 % CI 26-53), respectively; 42 % (95 % CI 26-58) and 16 % (95 % CI 5-31), respectively, for R1 resections; no patients who received an R2 resection survived to the 3-year mark. Patients with prior abdominoperineal excision (APE) had significantly poorer survival rates than patients with prior resection with anastomosis (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Acceptable long-term survival can be achieved for patients undergoing surgery for LRRC, but radical resection is mandatory. Prior APE was associated with poorer survival rates.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
