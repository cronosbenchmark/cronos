It was originally investigated for its antiviral effects, but it is now used as an anticancer therapy for various cancers.[A233135] Gemcitabine is a cytidine analog with two fluorine atoms replacing the hydroxyl on the ribose.[A233145] As a prodrug, gemcitabine is transformed into its active metabolites that work by replacing the building blocks of nucleic acids during DNA elongation, arresting tumour growth and promoting apoptosis of malignant cells.[L32960] The structure, metabolism, and mechanism of action of gemcitabine are similar to [cytarabine], but gemcitabine has a wider spectrum of antitumour activity.[A233140]\r\n\r\nGemcitabine is marketed as Gemzar and it is available as intravenous injection. It is approved by the FDA to treat advanced ovarian cancer in combination with [carboplatin], metastatic breast cancer in combination with [paclitaxel], non-small cell lung cancer in combination with [cisplatin], and pancreatic cancer as monotherapy.[L32950] It is also being investigated in other cancer and tumour types.\nOxaliplatin: Oxaliplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nCapecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers. Capecitabine is a prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to fluorouracil (antimetabolite) in the tumor, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor tissue.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0028198-T01-IM6\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0028198\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Pancreatic Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Pancreas\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT468\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 662, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 20.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"PAAD\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

NACT is known to induce a spectrum of histological changes in PDAC. Different grading regression systems are currently available; unfortunately, they lack precision and accuracy. We aimed to identify a new quantitative prognostic index based on tumor morphology. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study population was composed of 69 patients with resectable or borderline resectable PDAC treated with preoperative NACT (neoadjuvant group) and 36 patients submitted to upfront surgery (upfront-surgery group). A comprehensive histological assessment on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections evaluated 20 morphological parameters. The association between patient survival and morphological variables was evaluated to generate a prognostic index. RESULTS: The distribution of morphological parameters evaluated was significantly different between upfront-surgery and neoadjuvant groups, demonstrating the effect of NACT on tumor morphology. On multivariate analysis for patients that received NACT, the predictors of shorter overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were perineural invasion and lymph node ratio. Conversely, high stroma to neoplasia ratio predicted longer OS and DFS. These variables were combined to generate a semiquantitative prognostic index based on both OS and DFS, which significantly distinguished patients with poor outcomes from those with a good outcome. Bootstrap analysis confirmed the reproducibility of the model. CONCLUSIONS: The pathologic prognostic index proposed is mostly quantitative in nature, easy to use, and may represent a reliable tumor regression grading system to predict patient outcomes after NACT followed by surgery for PDAC.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 32083290\nTitle: Adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatment for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Motoi F, Unno M\nJournal: Japanese journal of clinical oncology\nPublication Date: 2020 May 5\nAbstract: The prognosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma is dismal. Hence, advances in multidisciplinary treatment strategies, including surgery, are urgently needed. Early recurrence of distant organ metastases suggests that there are occult metastases even in cases with resectable disease. Several randomized controlled trials on adjuvant chemotherapy have been conducted to prolong survival after resection. CONKO-001 study was the first to demonstrate significant improvement in disease-free survival after surgery with gemcitabine administration. The JASPAC-01 study showed the superiority of adjuvant S1 over gemcitabine in survival after resection. Based on the results, adjuvant S1 therapy is the prescribed standard of care in Japan. Recently, the PRODIGE 24/CCTG PA.6 study showed that survival of patients treated with a modified FOLFIRINOX regimen as adjuvant therapy was significantly longer than those treated with adjuvant gemcitabine therapy. Although the evidence from these trials on adjuvant chemotherapy have been the gold-standard treatment for curatively resected and fully recovered patients, resectable disease at diagnosis is not the status, resected disease after curative resection. Currently, neoadjuvant therapy is considered to be a promising alternative to surgery for pancreatic cancer. Although there are many reports regarding neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, so far there has been no solid evidence proving the advantage of this strategy versus standard up-front surgery. Newly obtained results from the Prep-02/JSAP05 randomized phase II/III study, comparing neoadjuvant therapy with up-front surgery, revealed significant improvement in overall survival with neoadjuvant chemotherapy by intention-to-treat analysis. Thus, neoadjuvant intervention might become a new standard strategy in cases undergoing planned resection for pancreatic cancer.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 28945895\nTitle: Selecting patients for resection after primary chemotherapy for non-metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Reni M, Zanon S, Balzano G\nJournal: Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology\nPublication Date: 2017 Nov 1\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Patients with borderline (BL) or locally advanced (LA) pancreatic adenocarcinoma are usually treated with primary chemotherapy (CT), followed by resection when feasible. Scanty data are available about the criteria to candidate patients to resection after CT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2002 and 2016 overall 223 patients diagnosed with BL or LA pancreatic adenocarcinoma were primarily treated with Gemcitabine combination (4-drugs or nab-paclitaxel-gemcitabine) for 3-6 months followed by surgery and/or chemoradiation. Resection was carried out when radical resection could be predicted by imaging studies and intraoperative findings. The prognostic value of both pre-treatment factors and treatment response was retrospectively evaluated, searching for criteria that could improve the selection of patients for surgery. RESULTS: Median survival (MS) for the whole population was 18.3 months. Surgical resection was carried out in 61 patients; MS in resected patients was significantly longer (30.0 months) as compared with 162 non-resected patients (16.5 months) (P < 0.00001). According to response criteria, 48% had a radiological partial response, 47% a stable disease and 5% a disease progression); CA19.9 response (reduction >50%) was obtained in 77.8% of patients. Among resected patients, neither pre-treatment factors, including BL/LA distinction, nor radiological response, were able to prognosticate survival differences. Survival of resected patients having no CA19.9 response was significantly lower as compared with responders (MS 15.0 versus 31.5 months, P = 0.04), and was similar to non-responders patients that did not undergo resection (MS 10.9 months, P= 0.25). Multivariate analysis carried out on the overall population, showed that Karnofsky performance status, T3-T4 status, resection and CA19.9 response were independent prognostic factors, while radiological response, BL/LA distinction and baseline CA19.9 had not significant influence on survival. CONCLUSIONS: CA19.9 response may allow a better selection of patients who will benefit from resection after primary CT for BL or LA pancreatic adenocarcinoma.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

(2017) found that CA19.9 response was an independent prognostic factor for survival, and patients with a radiological partial response or stable disease had better outcomes.\n\nConsidering the patient's treatment history, laboratory results, and the PubMed search results, I predict that the patient's cancer is likely to be in a state of stable disease or partial response, given the fluctuations in CA 19-9 and CEA levels, and the patient's age.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis of the patient's data and the PubMed search results, I will maintain my previous prediction.\n\n[ANSWER: B]"

Here, we investigate spatially organised immune determinants of PDAC recurrence. DESIGN: PDACs (n=284; discovery cohort) were classified according to recurrence site as liver (n=93/33%), lung (n=49/17%), local (n=31/11%), peritoneal (n=38/13%) and no-recurrence (n=73/26%). Spatial compartments were identified by fluorescent imaging as: pancytokeratin (PanCK)(+)CD45(-) (tumour cells); CD45(+)PanCK(-) (leucocytes) and PanCK(-)CD45(-) (stromal cells), followed by transcriptomic (72 genes) and proteomic analysis (51 proteins) for immune pathway targets. Results from next-generation sequencing (n=194) were integrated. Finally, 10 tumours from each group underwent immunophenotypic analysis by multiplex immunofluorescence. A validation cohort (n=109) was examined in parallel. RESULTS: No-recurrent PDACs show high immunogenicity, adaptive immune responses and are rich in pro-inflammatory chemokines, granzyme B and alpha-smooth muscle actin(+) fibroblasts. PDACs with liver and/or peritoneal recurrences display low immunogenicity, stemness phenotype and innate immune responses, whereas those with peritoneal metastases are additionally rich in FAP(+) fibroblasts. PDACs with local and/or lung recurrences display interferon-gamma signalling and mixed adaptive and innate immune responses, but with different leading immune cell population. Tumours with local recurrences overexpress dendritic cell markers whereas those with lung recurrences neutrophilic markers. Except the exclusive presence of RNF43 mutations in the no-recurrence group, no genetic differences were seen. The no-recurrence group exhibited the best, whereas liver and peritoneal recurrences the poorest prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate distinct inflammatory/stromal responses in each recurrence group, which might affect dissemination patterns and patient outcomes. These findings may help to inform personalised adjuvant/neoadjuvant and surveillance strategies in PDAC, including immunotherapeutic modalities.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 40086295\nTitle: Prediction of early recurrence as a marker of surgical futility in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Citterio D, Droz Dit Busset M, Sposito C\nJournal: Surgical oncology\nPublication Date: 2025 Apr\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Long-term survival after resection for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is impaired by very high recurrence rates. When recurrence occurs within 6 months (early recurrence: ER) the benefit of surgery is equivalent to palliative chemotherapy in unresectable patients. Therefore, ER is a surrogate of surgical futility in PDAC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To investigate predictive factors of ER and its impact on survival, a training and a validation cohort of prospectively collected patients who underwent surgery for resectable or borderline-resectable PDAC were analyzed in two independent Pancreas Units during the same period. Logistic regression model on the training cohort identified independent predictors of ER, used to build a prognostic risk-score then tested on the validation cohort. RESULTS: Out of 176 patients in the training cohort, 21.6 % experienced ER, with significant impact on survival (OS: 9.7 months vs. 32.7 months for ER vs. late/no recurrence, respectively). At multivariable analysis, three independent risk factors for ER were identified: Ca19.9 > 100 U/mL, G3 tumors and lack of adjuvant chemotherapy. Based on such features the derived ER-score stratified three prognostic classes at incremental risk of ER (12 %, 35 % and 53 %) with different OS (31.1, 19.7 and 9.3 months, respectively, p < 0.001). The ER predictive score was then tested on a validation cohort of 242 patients, 22.3 % of whom underwent ER. Despite significant differences in tumor-related features, the score was able to discriminate among the predicted ER-risk classes (15 %, 27 % and 53 %, respectively) and forecast significantly different OS (5.8, 19 and 31.1 months, p > 0.001). The discriminative capability of the score in the two cohorts was similar (training AUC = 0.72 vs. validation AUC = 0.68, p = 0.28). CONCLUSION: An externally validated clinical score, able to identify three prognostic classes at incremental risk of developing ER after resection of PDAC is provided. In patients at high risk of ER, prediction of surgical futility may help in decision-making.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 30945087\nTitle: Clinicopathological Features, Recurrence Patterns, and Prognosis of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma with Normal Serum CA19-9. A Consecutive Series of 154 Cases from a Single Institute.\nAuthors: Zhao Y, Wang C\nJournal: Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract\nPublication Date: 2020 Apr\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Serum levels of CA19-9 correlate with recurrence and survival in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma; however, little is known about the features and prognosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma with normal CA19-9 levels. METHOD: Patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (n = 806) were split into two groups with normal (</= 37 U/mL) and elevated (> 37 U/mL) CA19-9. The clinicopathological features, survival, and recurrence patterns were compared between two groups. We also sought to identify factors that best predicted prognosis in pancreatic adenocarcinoma with normal CA19-9 levels, to assist in the selection of the most effective adjuvant treatment. RESULTS: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma with normal CA19-9 were less likely to have lymph node metastasis, angiolymphatic invasion, intrapancreatic neural invasion, anterior serosal invasion, and invasion of the surrounding tissue/organ (distal bile duct, duodenum, or splenic artery or vein). Following propensity-score matching, pancreatic adenocarcinoma with normal CA19-9 levels (</= 37 U/ml) were associated with significantly superior overall survival following resection. Moreover, the CA19-9 </= 37 U/mL group demonstrated a significantly lower rate of local recurrence (35.57% vs. 52.35%, p = 0.004), distant recurrence (42.95% vs. 60.4%, p = 0.003), and mixed recurrence (5.37% vs. 29.53%, p < 0.000) compared with the CA19-9 > 37 U/mL group. Multivariate analysis suggested that angiolymphatic invasion, lymph node metastases, and tumor size > 3 cm were independent prognostic factors for pancreatic adenocarcinoma with normal CA19-9. Survival analyses suggested that post-op chemoradiotherapy or chemotherapy were associated with more favorable outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma with normal pretreatment CA19-9 levels (</= 37 U/ml) were characterized by better biological characteristics, reduced rates of recurrence, and longer overall survival. Moreover, optimal adjuvant therapy should be performed after surgery.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

NACT is known to induce a spectrum of histological changes in PDAC. Different grading regression systems are currently available; unfortunately, they lack precision and accuracy.

In this study, we identified prognostic factors for survival and recurrence in patients with histologically proven pancreatic adenocarcinoma. METHODOLOGY: Between January 2003 and December 2009, 82 patients with histologically proven pancreatic adenocarcinoma were considered for this study. Follow-up consisted of personal contact with patients or review of electronic medical records at this center and was terminated on December 31, 2011 or upon the patient's death. RESULTS: Overall survival rates of all patients at 1, 3, and 5 years were 51.9, 21.6 and 16.0%. Preoperative jaundice was the only independent prognostic factor for total pancreatic cancer patients, while N stage and perineural invasion in pathological findings was identified as an independent prognostic factor for survival of patients with surgical resection. Chemotherapy was the only independent prognostic factor for survival of patients who underwent palliative surgical bypass. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative jaundice in any patients, lymph node metastasis, perineural invasion in patients with surgical resection, and chemotherapy in patients undergoing palliative surgical bypass are important prognostic factors for survival of pancreatic cancer.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 30945087\nTitle: Clinicopathological Features, Recurrence Patterns, and Prognosis of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma with Normal Serum CA19-9.

Multivariate analysis suggested that angiolymphatic invasion, lymph node metastases, and tumor size > 3 cm were independent prognostic factors for pancreatic adenocarcinoma with normal CA19-9. Survival analyses suggested that post-op chemoradiotherapy or chemotherapy were associated with more favorable outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma with normal pretreatment CA19-9 levels (</= 37 U/ml) were characterized by better biological characteristics, reduced rates of recurrence, and longer overall survival. Moreover, optimal adjuvant therapy should be performed after surgery.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 37658871\nTitle: Prognostic factor in patient with recurrent pancreatic adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Sumiyoshi T, Uemura K, Shintakuya R\nJournal: Langenbeck's archives of surgery\nPublication Date: 2023 Sep 2\nAbstract: PURPOSE: To elucidate prognostic factors for post-recurrence survival in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). METHODS: Patients who underwent curative-intent surgery for PDAC between January 2014 and May 2020 were identified. Among them, patients who had postoperative recurrences and received chemotherapy were retrospectively investigated. Independent prognostic factors for survival after recurrence were investigated using multivariate analyses. Eligible patients were divided into two groups according to the presence or absence of the identified prognostic factors, and survival times after recurrence were compared. RESULTS: Eighty-four patients with recurrent PDAC were included. Multivariate analysis showed that red blood cell (RBC) transfusion (HR, 2.80; p = 0.0051), low albumin level (HR, 1.84; p = 0.0402), and high carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) level at recurrence (HR, 2.11; p = 0.0258) were significant predictors of shorter survival after recurrence. The median survival times after recurrence in the transfusion and non-transfusion groups were 5.5 vs. 18.1 months (p < 0.0001), respectively; those in the low and normal albumin groups were 10.1 vs. 18.7 months (p = 0.0049), and those in the high and normal CA19-9 groups were 11.5 vs. 22.6 months (p = 0.0023), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: RBC transfusion, low albumin, and high CA19-9 levels at recurrence negatively affected survival after recurrence in patients with PDAC.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
