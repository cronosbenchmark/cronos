These include age, gender, location and local stage of tumours, cell differentiation, lymph node metastasis and vascular involvement. The recurrence rates of squamous cell carcinoma after curative surgery are high (34-79%). Tumour recurrence is categorized as locoregional or distant. Lymph node recurrence and haematogenous metastasis to solid organs (commonly to the lung) are the usual patterns of recurrence. Awareness of recurrence patterns, particularly on imaging studies, is essential for the diagnosis of recurrent tumours on follow-up examinations.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 21327531\nTitle: Prognostic factors for post-recurrence survival in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients with recurrence after resection.\nAuthors: Hsu PK, Wang BY, Huang CS\nJournal: Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract\nPublication Date: 2011 Apr\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE: The survival of recurrent esophageal cancer is poor. But reports regarding prognostic factors for post-recurrence survival are limited. We analyzed the recurrence pattern and the prognostic factors for post-recurrence survival in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with recurrence after resection. METHODS: Two hundred sixty-eight patients were included. Tumor recurrence occurred in 115 (42.9%) patients. Recurrence pattern was classified as locoregional, distant, and combined recurrence. The post-recurrence survival was defined as the interval between initial recurrence and either death or the last follow-up. RESULTS: Mediastinum lymphadenopathy was the most common site for locoregional recurrence, whereas lung, liver, and bone were the most common sites for distant recurrence. The overall 1- and 2-year post-recurrence survival rates were 32.6% and 12.6% with a median survival after recurrence of 6.0 months. The independent prognostic factors included liver recurrence (HR = 2.255, 95%CI = 1.073-4.741, p = 0.032), time to recurrence </=10 months (HR = 2.657, 95%CI = 1.438-4.911, p = 0.002), and no treatment for recurrences (HR = 2.745, 95%CI = 1.635-4.608, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We identify liver recurrence, early recurrence, and no treatment for recurrence as risk factors for dismal post-recurrence survival.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 30389303\nTitle: Lung squamous cell carcinoma: A postoperative recurrence analysis of keratinizing and nonkeratinizing subtypes.\nAuthors: Chen R, Yang X, Ding Z\nJournal: European journal of surgical oncology : the journal of the European Society of Surgical Oncology and the British Association of Surgical Oncology\nPublication Date: 2019 May\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: There is currently no definite clinical implication for the subtypes of lung squamous cell carcinoma according to the 2015 WHO classification. This study aimed to investigate postoperative recurrence of the two major subtypes of lung squamous cell carcinoma: keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma (KSCC) and nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma (NKSCC). METHODS: We identified the patients with KSCC and NKSCC who had undergone complete resection in Shanghai Chest Hospital between April 2015 and June 2016. Disease-free survival (DFS) was compared using Kaplan-Meier statistical analysis. Variables selected by univariate analysis were evaluated in multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS: A total of 334 patients included 231 (69.2%) cases with KSCC and 103 (30.8%) cases with NKSCC. There were more smokers in keratinizing than nonkeratinizing subtype (84.8% versus 72.8%, p\u202f=\u202f0.009). The percentage of stage \u2162 was higher in NKSCC than that in KSCC (35% versus 22.9%, p\u202f=\u202f0.012). The 2-year DFS rates of stage \u2160, stage \u2161 and stage \u2162 were 90.1%, 66.4% and 37.7% in KSCC, 83.3%, 67.7% and 52.8% in NKSCC, respectively. There were no significant differences of 2-year DFS rates between KSCC and NKSCC. Furthermore, KSCC and NKSCC had no significant differences in recurrence patterns and metastatic sites. CONCLUSION: There were no significant differences of postoperative recurrence between KSCC and NKSCC.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
