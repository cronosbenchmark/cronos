In this study, we conditionally deleted E-cadherin in an autochthonous lung adenocarcinoma mouse model driven by activated oncogenic Kras and p53 loss. Loss of E-cadherin significantly accelerated lung adenocarcinoma progression and decreased survival of the mice. Kras;p53;E-cadherin mice had a 41% lung tumor burden, invasive grade 4 tumors, and a desmoplastic stroma just 8 weeks after tumor initiation. One hundred percent of the mice developed local metastases to the lymph nodes or chest wall, and 38% developed distant metastases to the liver or kidney. Lung adenocarcinoma cancer cell lines derived from these tumors also had high migratory rates. These studies demonstrate that the Kras;p53;E-cadherin mouse model better emulates the tumor microenvironment and metastases observed in patients with lung adenocarcinoma than previous models and may therefore be useful for studying metastasis and testing new lung cancer treatments in vivo.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 37619407\nTitle: Stepwise progression of invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma based on radiological and biological characteristics.\nAuthors: Goto E, Takamochi K, Kishikawa S\nJournal: Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)\nPublication Date: 2023 Oct\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION: Invasive mucinous lung adenocarcinoma (IMA) has unique radiological findings and pathological characteristics. IMA is classified into solitary and pneumonic types; however, it is unclear whether these are biologically identical. METHODS: A single-center retrospective analysis was performed for 70 IMA patients (solitary type [n = 38] and pneumonic type [n = 32]) who underwent pulmonary resection between January 2010 and December 2018. We compared clinical and biological characteristics between the two types. RESULTS: The frequencies of genetic alternations such as EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, GNAS, ERBB2, TP53, NRG1, and MET were not different. Immunohistochemically, expression of MUC1 was significantly more common in the pneumonic type (5.0% versus 20.0%, p = 0.01) and diffuse MUC6 positive in the solitary type (39.0% versus 13.0%, p = 0.02). We further classified solitary types into those with or without ground-glass opacity (GGO) and pneumonic types into those with or without crazy-paving appearance (CPA), and evaluated their surgical outcomes. Five-year overall survival and relapse free survival rates were 95.8%/86.6%, 64.3%/70.7%, 74.6%/68.9%, and 50.0%/28.6% in patients with solitary type with GGO, solitary type without GGO, pneumonic type without CPA, and pneumonic type with CPA, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: There were no differences in genetic alternations; however, mucin expression pattern was different. Surgical outcomes were different according to the presence of GGO in the solitary type and the presence of CPA in the pneumonic type. These findings suggested a stepwise progression from solitary to pneumonic IMA.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 35223450\nTitle: Outcomes in Patients With Lung Adenocarcinoma With Transformation to Small Cell Lung Cancer After EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors Resistance: A Systematic Review and Pooled Analysis.\nAuthors: Xu J, Xu L, Wang B\nJournal: Frontiers in oncology\nPublication Date: 2021\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Lung adenocarcinoma can transform into small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) when resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) develops. Approximately 3% to 10% of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) could transform to SCLC. This phenomenon has been described in several case reports and small patient series. However, the characteristics and treatment outcomes of this population have not been comprehensively reported, and their clinical course is poorly characterized. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the published literature to summarize the clinical and pathological features and prognosis of the reported cases and analyzed the demographics, disease features, and outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 72 patients (50 females and 22 males) initially diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma were included. EGFR mutations included 19-deletion (75%), L858R (22%), and G719X (3%). All patients received EGFR-TKIs before SCLC transformation. The median time from diagnosis to transformation was 20.5 months (95% CI, 15.45 to 26.55 months). Of the 67 patients with post-translational gene test results, 58 maintained their EGFR mutation, and only 1 of 18 with prior T790M positivity retained T790M mutation. After the pathological transformation, both conventional chemotherapy regimen and chemotherapy combined targeted therapy yielded high response rates. The disease control rate of first-line therapy after transformation was 76%, while the objective response rate was 48%. The median overall survival (OS) since diagnosis was 27 months (95% CI, 22.90 to 31.10 months), whereas median OS since SCLC transformation was 8.5 months (95% CI, 5.50 to 11.60 months). CONCLUSION: The prognosis of transformed SCLC is worse than primary SCLC. The response rate to conventional chemotherapy was high. However, the progression-free survival and OS after transformation were short and the prognosis was poor with first-line therapies. New therapies are needed in the management of transformed SCLC.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
