carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

The aim of this study was to identify factors related to receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy and its impact on recurrence and survival. METHODS: This was a multicentre retrospective study of patients undergoing pancreatic resection for adenocarcinoma arising from intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia between January 2010 and December 2020 at 18 centres. Recurrence and survival outcomes for patients who did and did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy were compared using propensity score matching. RESULTS: Of 459 patients who underwent pancreatic resection, 275 (59.9%) received adjuvant chemotherapy (gemcitabine 51.3%, gemcitabine-capecitabine 21.8%, FOLFIRINOX 8.0%, other 18.9%). Median follow-up was 78 months. The overall recurrence rate was 45.5% and the median time to recurrence was 33 months. In univariable analysis in the matched cohort, adjuvant chemotherapy was not associated with reduced overall (P = 0.713), locoregional (P = 0.283) or systemic (P = 0.592) recurrence, disease-free survival (P = 0.284) or overall survival (P = 0.455). Adjuvant chemotherapy was not associated with reduced site-specific recurrence. In multivariable analysis, there was no association between adjuvant chemotherapy and overall recurrence (HR 0.89, 95% c.i. 0.57 to 1.40), disease-free survival (HR 0.86, 0.59 to 1.30) or overall survival (HR 0.77, 0.50 to 1.20). Adjuvant chemotherapy was not associated with reduced recurrence in any high-risk subgroup (for example, lymph node-positive, higher AJCC stage, poor differentiation). No particular chemotherapy regimen resulted in superior outcomes. CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy following resection of adenocarcinoma arising from intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia does not appear to influence recurrence rates, recurrence patterns or survival.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 39191599\nTitle: Pathologic complete response following neoadjuvant chemotherapy in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: Impact on survival and recurrence.\nAuthors: Tamburrino D, Arcangeli C, De Stefano F\nJournal: Surgery\nPublication Date: 2024 Nov\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant treatment in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is a rare occurrence. Similar to other malignancies, achieving a pathologic complete response in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma seems to correlate with improved survival. However, because of the rarity of such events, the true significance of pathologic complete response in pancreatic cancer remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of pathologic complete response on survival and recurrence. METHODS: In a single-center retrospective study, pathologic complete response was defined as no evidence of viable tumor cells in resected specimen entirely sampled according to a rigorous protocol and in which a residual tumor bed was identified. Disease-specific survival and disease-free survival were measured from surgery. Independent predictors for disease-specific survival and disease-free survival were examined. RESULTS: Overall, 403 patients were included. Pathologic complete response was found in 15 patients (3.8%), after chemotherapy alone. After a median follow-up of 42 months (95% CI 38-45), 3-year disease-specific survival was 87% in pathologic complete response patients vs 43% in those without pathologic complete response (P = .014). The recurrence rate was 40% (n = 6/15) in the pathologic complete response group compared with 69.8% (n = 271/388) in those without pathologic complete response. Disease-free survival was longer in the pathologic complete response group, with higher 1- and 3-year rates compared with the no-pathologic complete response group (80% vs 60% and 48% vs 24%, respectively). Pathologic complete response was found to be an independent protective factor for disease-specific survival (P = .035) but not for disease-free survival (P = .052). CONCLUSION: Pathologic complete response in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is not synonymous of cure but ensure a prolonged survival. Nevertheless, recurrence remains a significant concern, with high rates observed even among these exceptional responders.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 35641368\nTitle: Feasibility of local therapy for recurrent pancreatic cancer.\nAuthors: Sato H, Yoshida R, Yasui K\nJournal: Pancreatology : official journal of the International Association of Pancreatology (IAP) ... [et al.]\nPublication Date: 2022 Sep\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Despite advances in perioperative management, recurrence after curative pancreatectomy is a critical issue in the treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The significance of local therapy for recurrent PDAC remains unclear. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of patients with PDAC who underwent curative resection at our institution between January 2009 and December 2019. We examined the patterns of relapse and assessed the clinical outcomes of patients with recurrence who underwent local therapy, including surgical resection, radiotherapy, and radiofrequency ablation. RESULTS: A total of 246 patients with PDAC who underwent R0 or R1 resection were included in this study. The 3-year overall survival (OS) rate was 39.8%, and the 1-year recurrence-free survival rate was 51.2% for the entire population. Recurrence was observed in 172/246 (69.9%) patients, including multiple site recurrences in 50, liver metastasis in 41, locoregional recurrence in 34, and peritoneal dissemination in 27. Of the 172 patients, treatment was administered in 137 (79.7%), and 16 received local therapy, including surgical resection (n = 13), radiotherapy (n = 5), and RFA (n = 1). PS-matched analysis revealed that patients with recurrence who were treated with chemotherapy combined with local therapy showed better post-recurrence survival rates than those treated with chemotherapy alone (P = 0.016). Detailed clinical courses of these patients are presented in the main manuscript. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that a multimodal approach may improve the clinical outcomes of patients with recurrent PDAC.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

The overall 5-year survival rate for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma is around 9% for all stages, but it can vary significantly based on the stage at diagnosis and other factors.\n\nGiven this context, while it's difficult to provide an exact prediction without current diagnostic evaluations or more recent laboratory results, the patient's history and the nature of pancreatic adenocarcinoma suggest a guarded prognosis.\n\n[ANSWER: B]"
