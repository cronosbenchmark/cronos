Biomarkers are needed to stratify patients with DCIS for adjuvant therapy. We investigated the prognostic and predictive relevance of cell cycle progression (CCP) score in women with DCIS. We measured the expression of 23 genes involved in CCP with quantitative RT-PCR on RNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples, and assessed the correlation of a predefined score with histopathologic features and recurrence. The signature was analyzed in a cohort of 909 consecutive DCIS with full histopathological features treated in a single institution. The main outcome measure was ipsilateral breast event (IBE) as first event observed, be it in situ or invasive. Median follow-up time was 8.7 years (IQR 6.5-10.5 years). There were 150 ipsilateral IBEs, 84 (56%) of which were invasive. In the first 5 years of follow-up, the score provided statistically different findings (p = 0.009), with IBE rates of 14.7% (95% CI, 10.4-19.7) for the highest quartile of CCP score (Q4) and 8.7% (95% CI, 6.7-11.0) for the lowest quartiles (Q1-3). The prognostic value for IBEs approached significance also in women treated with mastectomy (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] Q4 vs. Q1-3 = 2.60; 95% CI: 0.96-7.08; P = 0.06). Radiotherapy provided a greater benefit in women with higher CCP score. In addition, Q4 predicted a different risk after tamoxifen depending on menopausal status, with a beneficial trend on IBEs in postmenopausal women (HR 0.30; 95% CI, 0.07-1.39), and an opposite trend in premenopausal women (HR 1.68; 95% CI, 0.38-7.44) (P-interaction = 0.03). The results of this study provide for the first time the evidence that CCP score is a prognostic marker, which, after additional validation, could have an important role in personalizing the management of DCIS.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 39180592\nTitle: Outcomes from low-risk ductal carcinoma in situ: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\nAuthors: Chen Q, Campbell I, Elwood M\nJournal: Breast cancer research and treatment\nPublication Date: 2024 Nov\nAbstract: PURPOSE: The current standard of treatment for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is surgery with or without adjuvant radiotherapy. With a growing debate about overdiagnosis and overtreatment of low-risk DCIS, active surveillance is being explored in several ongoing trials. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the recurrence of low-risk DCIS under various treatment approaches. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane were searched for studies reporting ipsilateral breast tumour event (IBTE), contralateral breast cancer (CBC), and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) rates at 5 and 10 years in low-risk DCIS. The primary outcome was invasive IBTE (iIBTE) defined as invasive progression in the ipsilateral breast. RESULTS: Thirty three eligible studies were identified, involving 47,696 women with low-risk DCIS. The pooled 5-year and 10-year iIBTE rates were 3.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3, 8.1) and 5.9% (95% CI: 3.8, 9.0), respectively. The iIBTE rates were significantly lower in patients who underwent surgery compared to those who did not, at 5 years (3.5% vs. 9.0%, P = 0.003) and 10 years (6.4% vs. 22.7%, P = 0.008). Similarly, the 10-year BCSS rate was higher in the surgery group (96.0% vs. 99.6%, P = 0.010). In patients treated with breast-conserving surgery, additional radiotherapy significantly reduced IBTE risk, but not total-CBC risk. CONCLUSION: This review showed a lower risk of progression and better survival in women who received surgery and additional RT for low-risk DCIS. However, our findings were primarily based on observational studies, and should be confirmed with the results from the ongoing trials.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 30085937\nTitle: Expression of programmed death ligand-1 and programmed death-1 in samples of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast and its correlation with prognosis.\nAuthors: Zhou T, Xu D, Tang B\nJournal: Anti-cancer drugs\nPublication Date: 2018 Oct\nAbstract: The aim of the current study is to investigate programmed death-1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expressions and to analyze the relationship between the expression of PD-L1 and PD-1 proteins and the molecular type, clinicopathological factors, and prognosis of invasive ductal carcinoma. We enrolled 136 patients with invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. The expression of PD-L1 in tumor cells and that of PD-1 on paratumor-infiltrating immune cells was detected by immunohistochemistry, and the data were analyzed using SPSS software. The positive expression rates of PD-L1 and PD-1 in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) were 47.8 and 43.5%, which were higher than those of other subtypes (P<0.05). The expression of PD-L1 in tumor cells was correlated with the expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and Ki-67 (P<0.05). The expression of PD-1 in the tumor-infiltrating immune cells was correlated with the expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and Ki-67 and the histological grade (P<0.05). The expression of PD-L1 in tumor cells was correlated with the expression of PD-1 in paratumor-infiltrating immune cells (P<0.001). The expression of PD-L1 in tumor cells was found to be an independent prognostic risk factor with the progression-free survival rate for breast invasive ductal carcinoma (P=0.003). These results indicate that PD-L1 and PD-1 were highly expressed in TNBC which suggests that patients with TNBC may benefit from targeted immune therapies to a greater degree than patients with other subtypes. PD-L1 expression is an independent risk factor for breast invasive ductal carcinoma and expression of PD-L1 is expected to be a prognostic factor for breast cancer.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

METHODS: We examined the survival experience of all women aged 50-74 years diagnosed with a first breast cancer between 1998 and 2006 in British Columbia, Canada and determined their screening experience. Disease-specific survival rates were calculated and, for cases diagnosed in 2002, prognostic factors (size, nodal involvement, grade ER status and stage) were examined by time since screening. RESULTS: Breast cancers diagnosed at screening had the best survival (P<0.001). Cancers detected within 12 months of a negative screen had similar survival rates (P=0.98) to those diagnosed within 12-23 and 24-47 months, with other non-screen-detected cancers having poorer survival (P<0.001). The prognostic profile of cancers diagnosed in 2002 followed a similar pattern. INTERPRETATION: There was no evidence that cancers diagnosed within 12 months had poorer prognosis than those diagnosed up to 48 months following screening.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 31343899\nTitle: Breast Cancer Survival Defined by Biological Receptor and Menopausal Status in Vietnamese Women.\nAuthors: Vu Hong T, Nguyen Ba D, Skoog L\nJournal: Cancer control : journal of the Moffitt Cancer Center\nPublication Date: 2019 Jan-Dec\nAbstract: Little is known about breast cancer in Vietnamese women. Previous studies have reported the frequencies of prognostic factors of breast cancer in this population. The aim of this study was to examine the prognostic factors associated with the survival rates of patients with breast cancer treated at the National Cancer Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam. We recruited 248 women with operable breast cancer treated with surgery and adjuvant therapy. Tumor tissue samples were stained by many immunohistochemical approaches and analyzed for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 gene amplification status. A Cox model was used to determine the relationship between survival and the prognostic factors. The disease-free survival rate, overall survival rate, and cancer-specific survival rate were 75.8%, 80.6%, and 86.4%, respectively, at 5 years and 62.3%, 68.1%, and 78.9%, respectively, at 10 years. The lung was the most common metastatic site. Women with factors associated with a poor prognosis (eg, advanced clinical stage, high tumor grade, progesterone receptor [PR] negativity, HER2 amplification) had significantly lower survival rates. Patients with PR-negative breast cancer had significantly worse survival rates compared to those who were PR positive, according to multivariate analysis (hazard ratio = 1.77, 95% confidence interval: 1.01-3.11, P = .045); however, there was only a statistically significant difference in postmenopausal patients. The PR was a prognostic factor in postmenopausal women with breast cancer, but not in premenopausal women.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 29927171\nTitle: Survival and Prognostic Factors of Metastatic Breast Cancer.\nAuthors: Laohavinij S, Paul V, Maneenil K\nJournal: Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand = Chotmaihet thangphaet\nPublication Date: 2017 Feb\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Prognostic factors for survival of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients are important for identifying risks and deciding on patient treatment; however, few studies of prognostic factors in MBC have been performed in Thailand. OBJECTIVE: To determine the survival duration and prognostic factors for overall survival in metastatic breast cancer. MATERIAL AND METHOD: This retrospective cohort study was conducted by reviewing 232 files of MBC patients treated in the Oncology Unit, Department of Medicine, Rajavithi Hospital from January 1st 2005 to December 31th 2013. RESULTS: There were 232 patients whose median age was 51.5 years. The 1-year, 3-year and 5-year overall survival rates for MBC patients were 53.2%, 18.7% and 7.3% respectively, and the median overall survival time of all MBC patients was 13.43 months. Multivariate analysis showed that large tumor size T4 (HR = 1.89, 95% CI 1.04-3.44; p = 0.038), ECOG performance status 3-4 (HR = 2.44, 95% CI 1.48-4.00; p<0.001) and treatment with best supportive care only (HR = 5.95, 95% CI 3.56-9.96; p<0.001) were significant prognostic factors for poor overall survival in MBC. Breast cancer subtype analysis showed that luminal-A subtype was associated with a high rate of late recurrence (beyond 2 years) (p = 0.016) and HER-2 enriched subtype was related to a high rate of early relapse (before 2 years (p = 0.001)). CONCLUSION: The important prognostic factors for overall survival in MBC were tumor size, ECOG PS and type of first-line treatment. In order to improve survival outcomes, patients with large tumor size should be treated with intensive chemotherapy and targeted therapy if HER-2 status positive. It is essential that early breast cancer patients have an awareness of recurrent diseases in order to identify good performance status in MBC patients suitable for active treatment.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

The patient's cancer has been monitored through regular CT scans and lab tests, and it has been reported that the cancer has not progressed in several instances.\n\nAccording to the provided genomic profiling results, the patient's sample has been analyzed using the IMPACT468 gene panel, which provides information on the patient's cancer type and subtype. The results indicate that the patient has breast invasive ductal carcinoma with a tumor purity of 40.0.\n\nConsidering the patient's age, medical history, and treatment response, as well as the genomic profiling results, I can provide a final answer to the question .\n\nGiven that the patient is 52 years old, and based on the provided medical history and treatment information, I believe that the patient is likely to be alive in the next 12 months.\n\nTo confirm this assessment, I would like to review the PUBMED search results on breast cancer survival rates and prognosis in 50-year-old women.\n\nSince I have already received the PUBMED search results, I can review the patient's history and provide a final answer to the question.\n\nAccording to the PUBMED search results, breast cancer survival rates and prognosis vary depending on several factors, including screening history, biological receptors, and menopausal status. The search results suggest that breast cancers detected within 12 months of a negative screen have similar survival rates to those diagnosed within 12-23 and 24-47 months, with other non-screen-detected cancers having poorer survival .\n\nBased on the patient's detailed medical history, including information on diagnosis, treatments, and lab tests, for the period between 50 and 52 years of age, I can confirm that the patient's cancer has shown no progression over the past 12 months.\n\nGiven this information, I can provide a final answer to the question.\n\n[ANSWER: A]"
