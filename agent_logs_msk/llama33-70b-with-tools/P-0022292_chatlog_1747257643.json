Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

We aimed to devise a radiomics signature (RS) to predict these outcomes for further risk stratification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma and SD after chemotherapy were included. Pancreatic lesions on initial postchemotherapy computed tomography images were evaluated by radiomics analysis for predicting early death (</= 1 year). RS was then internally and externally tested. The progression-free survival and objective response rate were compared between the low-risk and high-risk group of patients classified following RS. RESULTS: Approximately 62.7% of patients receiving chemotherapy showed SD at first response evaluation in the primary cohort, which were 59.6% and 57.9% in internal and external testing cohorts, respectively. The RS predicted 1-year overall survival well, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91 in the training cohort, 0.90 in the validation cohort, 0.84 in the internal testing cohort, and 0.87 in the external testing cohort. The high-risk group had a shorter median progression-free survival (7.3 months v 9.0 months, P = .016, in the training cohort; 5.9 months v 9.2 months, P = .026, in the internal testing cohort) and a lower objective response rate (2.2% v 24.0% in the training cohort) than the low-risk group. In addition, RS was not related to the clinical characteristics and chemotherapy regimens. CONCLUSION: RS independently predicts the outcomes of patients with SD after chemotherapy well and can help to improve treatment decisions by identifying patients for whom current treatment may not be suitable.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 39221763\nTitle: Prognostic value of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio in patients with advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma treated with systemic chemotherapy.\nAuthors: Kitsugi K, Kawata K, Noritake H\nJournal: Annals of medicine\nPublication Date: 2024 Dec\nAbstract: OBJECTIVES: Although systemic chemotherapy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has made progress, ensuring long-term survival remains difficult. There are several reports on the usefulness of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in predicting the prognosis of PDAC, but few reports in systemic chemotherapy. We hereby investigated the usefulness of NLR in systemic chemotherapy for PDAC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on patients with advanced PDAC treated with first-line systemic chemotherapy. Cox regression hazards models were performed to analyze the association between baseline patient characteristics and the initial treatment response, and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: A total of 60 patients with PDAC were enrolled. At baseline, there were significant differences in NLR and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), as well as the selection rate of combination chemotherapy, between patients with partial response or stable disease and those with progressive disease. Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that NLR < 3.10, combination chemotherapy, and CA19-9 < 1011 U/mL were significant and independent predictive factors of the initial treatment response. Meanwhile, NLR < 3.10 and combination chemotherapy were independently associated with longer OS. Moreover, OS was significantly prolonged in patients with NLR < 3.10, regardless of whether combination chemotherapy or monotherapy. Patients with NLR < 3.10 at baseline had a significantly higher conversion rate to third-line chemotherapy and a longer duration of total chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that NLR may be a useful marker for predicting the initial treatment response to first-line chemotherapy and the prognosis for patients with advanced PDAC.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 29232340\nTitle: Ablative Therapies for Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer.\nAuthors: Shah R, Ostapoff KT, Kuvshinoff B\nJournal: Pancreas\nPublication Date: 2018 Jan\nAbstract: The vast majority of patients who present with pancreatic adenocarcinoma have locally advanced or metastatic disease at the time of presentation without possibility of cure. Although in recent years there have been some new promising chemotherapy regimens that improve overall survival by a few months, the prognosis remains dismal. There is, however, a subset of patients who experience durable stable disease or partial responses after initial courses of chemotherapy with locally advanced disease. In these select patients, there remains interest in local ablative therapy with or without resection as a means for local control, palliation of symptoms, and possible improved survival. This review describes the techniques, complications, and expected benefits of several ablative techniques as a treatment modality for locally advanced pancreatic cancer.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1996 and January 2001, 33 consecutive patients (18 males and 15 women, mean age 63 years) with locally advanced PA were treated with chemotherapy and concurrent external-beam radiotherapy. Radiotherapy delivered 45-50.4 Gy, in a classical manner (N=27) or on a split-course (N=6). Chemotherapy was made of 5FU by continuous infusion for all patients during 5 weeks and cisplatin at the 1st and 5th weeks (N=22). Tumor resectability was reassessed at the end of the chemoradiotherapy; surgical resection of tumour was attempted in patients whose tumor demonstrated reduction in size, and supplementary radiotherapy of 10 to 15 Gy was delivered to the others. RESULTS: Thirty-nine percent of patients experienced grade 3 acute toxicity. WHO criteria response to chemoradiotherapy four weeks after the end of treatment were: 4 partial responders (12%), 6 minor responders (18%), 14 stable disease (42%), 9 progression (28%). Ten patients underwent exploratory laparotomy, in one case vascular encasement did not allow for tumor resection, and in another patient, there was peritoneal carcinomatosis. In the 8 remaining patients, surgical (R0) resection was possible. In one patient histological examination showed fibrosis with no residual tumour. After a median follow-up period of 40 months, median survival was 16 months (66% and 37% of survival at 1 and 2 years respectively). In operated and non-operated patients, survival rates at 24 months were 73% and 12.5% respectively. At 1 year, 80% of the patients treated with radiochemotherapy developed recurrence, metastatic recurrence in 88%. Initial laparotomy, split course radiotherapy were poor outcome factors whereas chemotherapy appears to be a favorable outcome factor. CONCLUSION: Subsequent resection of locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma is possible after chemoradiotherapy allowing for a prolonged survival in some patients.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 31281650\nTitle: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine-based regimens improves the prognosis of node positive resectable pancreatic head cancer.\nAuthors: Tajima H, Ohta T, Okazaki M\nJournal: Molecular and clinical oncology\nPublication Date: 2019 Aug\nAbstract: The effectiveness of preoperative (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy (NAC) for resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains unclear. The present study retrospectively evaluated the efficacy of NAC with gemcitabine (GEM)-based regimens or GEM monotherapy for resectable PDAC. Between 2006 and 2015, NAC with GEM was performed in 52 cases (head 31, and body and tail 21) and compared with 34 resection-only cases serving as controls (head 20, and body and tail 14). According to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors guidelines, the treatment effect was a partial response in 5 cases, stable disease in 45 cases, and progressive disease in 2 cases. Maximum standardized uptake values and carbohydrate antigen (CA19-9) values were significantly reduced after preoperative chemotherapy. Using the Evans grading system, the treatment effect was grade I in 31 patients, grade IIa in 8, and grade IIb in 3 cases. There were significant differences in the overall survival rate between the NAC and control groups, only in the patients with node-positive pancreatic head cancer. Significantly higher CA19-9 values in peripheral blood and higher lymph node metastasis and plexus invasion rates were observed in early-recurring cases within a year. The preoperative CA 19-9 cutoff value as an early recurrence risk factor was calculated as 30 U/ml in the NAC group and 88 U/ml in the control group. NAC with GEM prolonged survival in patients with node-positive pancreatic head cancer. High CA19-9 values before operation, lymph node metastases and plexus invasion were risk factors for early tumor recurrence after surgery. Preoperative chemotherapy would be necessary for resectable pancreatic head cancer as lymph node metastasis was observed in >60% with resectable PDAC. Moreover, if normalization of CA19-9 values is not achieved with NAC, extension of preoperative chemotherapy should be considered as for borderline resectable PDAC cases.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 20056351\nTitle: Estimating optimal dose of twice-weekly gemcitabine for concurrent chemoradiotherapy in unresectable pancreatic carcinoma: mature results of GEMRT-01 Phase I trial.\nAuthors: Girard N, Mornex F, Bossard N\nJournal: International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics\nPublication Date: 2010 Aug 1\nAbstract: PURPOSE: To accurately determine the maximal tolerated dose, feasibility, and antitumor activity of concurrent chemoradiotherapy including twice-weekly gemcitabine in patients with unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eligible patients with histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were included in this Phase I trial. Radiotherapy was delivered to a total dose of 50 Gy. Concurrent chemotherapy with twice-weekly gemcitabine was administered during the 5 weeks of radiotherapy, from an initial dose of 30 mg/m(2). The gemcitabine doses were escalated in 10-mg/m(2) increments in a three-plus-three design, until dose-limiting toxicities were observed. RESULTS: A total of 35 patients were included in the trial. The feasibility of chemoradiotherapy was high, because all the patients received the planned total radiation dose, and 26 patients (74%) received > or = 70% of the planned chemotherapy dose. The mean total delivered dose of gemcitabine was 417 mg/m(2) (i.e., 77% of the prescribed dose). The maximal tolerated dose of twice-weekly gemcitabine was 70 mg/m(2). Of the 35 patients, 13 had a partial response (37%) and 21 had stable disease (60%). Overall, the median survival and the 6-, 12-, and 18-month survival rates were 10.6 months and 82%, 31%, and 11%, respectively. Survival was significantly longer in patients with an initial performance status of 0 or 1 (p = .004). CONCLUSION: Our mature data have indicated that gemcitabine doses can be increased < or = 70 mg/m(2), when delivered twice-weekly with concurrent radiotherapy. This combination shows promises to achieve better recurrence-free and overall survival. These results will serve as a basis for further implementation of the multimodal treatment of locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

   \n\n[DrugBank: Gemcitabine: Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analog and a chemotherapeutic agent. It was originally investigated for its antiviral effects, but it is now used as an anticancer therapy for various cancers.[A233135] Gemcitabine is a cytidine analog with two fluorine atoms replacing the hydroxyl on the ribose.[A233145] As a prodrug, gemcitabine is transformed into its active metabolites that work by replacing the building blocks of nucleic acids during DNA elongation, arresting tumour growth and promoting apoptosis of malignant cells.[L32960] The structure, metabolism, and mechanism of action of gemcitabine are similar to [cytarabine], but gemcitabine has a wider spectrum of antitumour activity.[A233140]\r\n\r\nGemcitabine is marketed as Gemzar and it is available as intravenous injection. It is approved by the FDA to treat advanced ovarian cancer in combination with [carboplatin], metastatic breast cancer in combination with [paclitaxel], non-small cell lung cancer in combination with [cisplatin], and pancreatic cancer as monotherapy.[L32950] It is also being investigated in other cancer and tumour types.\nOxaliplatin: Oxaliplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nCapecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers. Capecitabine is a prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to fluorouracil (antimetabolite) in the tumor, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor tissue.\nPaclitaxel: Paclitaxel is a chemotherapeutic agent marketed under the brand name Taxol among others. Used as a treatment for various cancers, paclitaxel is a mitotic inhibitor that was first isolated in 1971 from the bark of the Pacific yew tree which contains endophytic fungi that synthesize paclitaxel. It is available as an intravenous solution for injection and the newer formulation contains albumin-bound paclitaxel marketed under the brand name Abraxane.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

The role of surgical treatment for recurrent pancreatic cancer is not well established. METHODS: Patients who underwent primary pancreatectomy with curative intent from 2000 to 2014 at a single large-volume centre were evaluated retrospectively. CT or PET was used to select patients with an isolated recurrence. The clinicopathological features and survival outcomes were compared according to treatment modalities. RESULTS: Of the 1610 patients with pancreatic cancer who underwent resection, 1346 (83.6 per cent) were diagnosed with recurrent pancreatic cancer. Recurrence was locoregional in 366 patients (27.2 per cent), distant multifocal in 251 (18.6 per cent), distant isolated in 188 (14.0 per cent), locoregional plus distant in 153 (11.4 per cent) and peritoneal seeding in 388 (28.8 per cent). Of the 1346 patients with recurrence, 197 (14.6 per cent) had isolated recurrence; of these, 48 (24.4 per cent of all isolated recurrences; 3.6 per cent of all recurrences) underwent resection. Median survival of the 197 patients after diagnosis of isolated recurrence was 14.7 months; it was longer in patients who underwent surgical resection than among those treated non-surgically (23.5 versus 12.0 months; P = 0.014). Multivariable analysis showed that chemotherapy and resection for recurrence were associated with better prognosis. Median survival after recurrence was longest in the 23 patients with isolated pulmonary recurrence (33.3 months). Survival after recurrence was better in patients who underwent resection of isolated recurrence in the remnant pancreas (median 28.0 versus 12.0 months, P = 0.010) and lung (median 36.5 versus 9.5 months; P = 0.010) than in those who did not undergo resection.

All English language articles pertaining to the role of CA 19-9 in pancreatic cancer were critically analyzed to determine its utility as a biomarker for pancreatic cancer. RESULTS: Serum CA 19-9 is the most extensively validated pancreatic cancer biomarker with multiple clinical applications. CA 19-9 serum levels have a sensitivity and specificity of 79-81% and 82-90% respectively for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in symptomatic patients; but are not useful as a screening marker because of low positive predictive value (0.5-0.9%). Pre-operative CA 19-9 serum levels provide useful prognostic information as patients with normal levels (<37 U/mL) have a prolonged median survival (32-36 months) compared to patients with elevated levels (>37 U/mL) (12-15 months). A CA 19-9 serum level of <100 U/mL implies likely resectable disease whereas levels >100 U/mL suggest unresectablity or metastatic disease. Normalization or a decrease in post-operative CA 19-9 serum levels by >/=20-50% from baseline following surgical resection or chemotherapy is associated with prolonged survival compared to failure of CA 19-9 serum levels to normalize or an increase. Important limitations to CA 19-9 serum level evaluation in pancreatic cancer include poor sensitivity, false negative results in Lewis negative phenotype (5-10%) and increased false positivity in the presence of obstructive jaundice (10-60%). CONCLUSIONS: CA 19-9 is the most extensively studied and validated serum biomarker for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in symptomatic patients. CA 19-9 serum levels can provide important information with regards to prognosis, overall survival, and response to chemotherapy as well as predict post-operative recurrence. However, non-specific expression in several benign and malignant diseases, false negative results in Lewis negative genotype and an increased false positive results in the presence of obstructive jaundice severely limit the universal applicability of serum CA 19-9 levels in pancreatic cancer management.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 23999775\nTitle: IPMN: surgical treatment.\nAuthors: Kappeli RM, Muller SA, Hummel B\nJournal: Langenbeck's archives of surgery\nPublication Date: 2013 Dec\nAbstract: PURPOSE: Cystic pancreatic tumors are being detected more frequently, and particularly, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia (IPMN) has recently attracted increased attention. The detection rate of IPMN has increased over the last decade; however, management of this neoplasm remains controversial. METHODS: Based on a review of the relevant literature and the international guidelines, we discuss the diagnostic evaluation of IPMN, its treatment, and prognosis. RESULTS: While IPMN represents only a distinct minority of all pancreatic cancers, they appear to be a relatively frequent neoplastic form of pancreatic cystic neoplasm. It may not be possible to differentiate main duct disease from branch duct disease (MD-IPMN vs. BD-IPMN) prior to surgery. This distinction has not only an impact on treatment but also on prognosis, as MD-IPMN is more often malignant. IPMN has updated consensus guideline indications for conservative and surgical resection. CONCLUSIONS: Since patients with IPMN of the pancreas are at risk of developing recurrent IPMN and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in the remnant pancreas and extrapancreatic malignancies, early recognition, treatment, and systemic surveillance are of great importance. No conclusions can be drawn from the available evidence with respect to the efficacy of surveillance and follow-up treatment programs. A better understanding of the natural course of IPMN and the biology of pancreatic cancer is mandatory to enable further diagnostic and treatment improvements.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

The role of surgical treatment for recurrent pancreatic cancer is not well established. METHODS: Patients who underwent primary pancreatectomy with curative intent from 2000 to 2014 at a single large-volume centre were evaluated retrospectively. CT or PET was used to select patients with an isolated recurrence. The clinicopathological features and survival outcomes were compared according to treatment modalities. RESULTS: Of the 1610 patients with pancreatic cancer who underwent resection, 1346 (83.6 per cent) were diagnosed with recurrent pancreatic cancer. Recurrence was locoregional in 366 patients (27.2 per cent), distant multifocal in 251 (18.6 per cent), distant isolated in 188 (14.0 per cent), locoregional plus distant in 153 (11.4 per cent) and peritoneal seeding in 388 (28.8 per cent). Of the 1346 patients with recurrence, 197 (14.6 per cent) had isolated recurrence; of these, 48 (24.4 per cent of all isolated recurrences; 3.6 per cent of all recurrences) underwent resection. Median survival of the 197 patients after diagnosis of isolated recurrence was 14.7 months; it was longer in patients who underwent surgical resection than among those treated non-surgically (23.5 versus 12.0 months; P = 0.014). Multivariable analysis showed that chemotherapy and resection for recurrence were associated with better prognosis. Median survival after recurrence was longest in the 23 patients with isolated pulmonary recurrence (33.3 months). Survival after recurrence was better in patients who underwent resection of isolated recurrence in the remnant pancreas (median 28.0 versus 12.0 months, P = 0.010) and lung (median 36.5 versus 9.5 months; P = 0.010) than in those who did not undergo resection.

OBJECTIVE: the goal of our study was to determine the survival and safety data of a number of patients that underwent a cephalic duodenopancreatectomy (CDP) with total mesopancreas excision (TMPE). MATERIAL AND METHODS: a prospective observational study was performed of 114 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma who underwent duodenopancreatectomy and TMPE over the period 2008-2017. Demographic variables, tumor stage, number of lymph nodes excised, lymph node ratio, R classification, the prognostic factor disease-free interval and survival were all assessed in a multivariate analysis. RESULTS: complications were reported for 54 (47.3%) patients, of which 22 (19.3%) were categorized as serious. The mortality rate was 4.3% and the mean follow-up was 26.2 months. During this period, 73 (64%) patients relapsed after a mean interval of 40.9 months. The relapse pattern was mainly hepatic (26.3%), followed by local relapse (20%). Mean survival was 40.38 and actuarial survival was 26.6% at five years. Relapse-related factors included stage T3 or higher (RR 8.1 [1.1-61]) and an R1 resection (RR 13.4 [2.7-66.5]) and survival-related factors included an R1 resection (RR 10.7 [2.5-46.2]). CONCLUSION: TMPE ensures an adequate lymphadenectomy and lymph node ratio according to reported standards. The survival of patients that have undergone surgery for pancreatic adenocarcinoma in our institution is 68.4% at one year and 26.6% at five years. An R1 resection is the primary factor for both relapse and survival.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 16702400\nTitle: Genetics and biology of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Hezel AF, Kimmelman AC, Stanger BZ\nJournal: Genes & development\nPublication Date: 2006 May 15\nAbstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States with a median survival of <6 mo and a dismal 5-yr survival rate of 3%-5%. The cancer's lethal nature stems from its propensity to rapidly disseminate to the lymphatic system and distant organs. This aggressive biology and resistance to conventional and targeted therapeutic agents leads to a typical clinical presentation of incurable disease at the time of diagnosis. The well-defined serial histopathologic picture and accompanying molecular profiles of PDAC and its precursor lesions have provided the framework for emerging basic and translational research. Recent advances include insights into the cancer's cellular origins, high-resolution genomic profiles pointing to potential new therapeutic targets, and refined mouse models reflecting both the genetics and histopathologic evolution of human PDAC. This confluence of developments offers the opportunity for accelerated discovery and the future promise of improved treatment.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 30487695\nTitle: Pancreatic cancer: A review of clinical diagnosis, epidemiology, treatment and outcomes.\nAuthors: McGuigan A, Kelly P, Turkington RC\nJournal: World journal of gastroenterology\nPublication Date: 2018 Nov 21\nAbstract: This review aims to outline the most up-to-date knowledge of pancreatic adenocarcinoma risk, diagnostics, treatment and outcomes, while identifying gaps that aim to stimulate further research in this understudied malignancy. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a lethal condition with a rising incidence, predicted to become the second leading cause of cancer death in some regions. It often presents at an advanced stage, which contributes to poor five-year survival rates of 2%-9%, ranking firmly last amongst all cancer sites in terms of prognostic outcomes for patients. Better understanding of the risk factors and symptoms associated with this disease is essential to inform both health professionals and the general population of potential preventive and/or early detection measures. The identification of high-risk patients who could benefit from screening to detect pre-malignant conditions such as pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and mucinous cystic neoplasms is urgently required, however an acceptable screening test has yet to be identified. The management of pancreatic adenocarcinoma is evolving, with the introduction of new surgical techniques and medical therapies such as laparoscopic techniques and neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy, however this has only led to modest improvements in outcomes. The identification of novel biomarkers is desirable to move towards a precision medicine era, where pancreatic cancer therapy can be tailored to the individual patient, while unnecessary treatments that have negative consequences on quality of life could be prevented for others. Research efforts must also focus on the development of new agents and delivery systems. Overall, considerable progress is required to reduce the burden associated with pancreatic cancer. Recent, renewed efforts to fund large consortia and research into pancreatic adenocarcinoma are welcomed, but further streams will be necessary to facilitate the momentum needed to bring breakthroughs seen for other cancer sites.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
