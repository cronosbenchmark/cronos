The objective of this retrospective study was to determine if single-agent chemotherapy (3rd-line or beyond) would yield improved ORR when given after exposure to programmed death-(ligand)1 inhibitors (anti-PD1) in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We queried the Thoracic GEMINI database of MD Anderson Cancer Center for patients treated between 06/12 and 11/16 who received at least one single-agent chemotherapy as 3rd-line or beyond, following progression after platinum-based chemotherapy and anti-PD1. We evaluated efficacy outcomes to each therapy, including ORR by RECIST version 1.1, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Out of 306 anti-PD1-treated patients registered in the database, 28 met eligibility criteria - 54% were male, median age was 66 years, 82% had adenocarcinoma, and 71% were former/current smokers. The anti-PD1 and single-agent chemotherapy most commonly used were nivolumab (86%) and docetaxel (50%), respectively. ORR to single-agent chemotherapy after exposure to anti-PD1 was 39% (11/28 patients, 8 confirmed). In contrast, ORR to first-line chemotherapy in this cohort was 37%. Liver metastasis was the only factor associated with response to single-agent chemotherapy on univariate analysis (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: In NSCLC patients, the confirmed ORR to single-agent chemotherapy after immunotherapy exposure was higher as compared to historical data from the pre-anti-PD1 era, and approached ORR to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Further investigation of a possible immunotherapy-induced chemosensitization effect is warranted.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 36812760\nTitle: Second-line treatment outcomes after progression from first-line chemotherapy plus immunotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.\nAuthors: Auclin E, Benitez-Montanez J, Tagliamento M\nJournal: Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)\nPublication Date: 2023 Apr\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION: Chemotherapy plus immunotherapy is the standard of care for patients with metastatic NSCLC. No study has evaluated the outcomes of second-line chemotherapy treatments after progression following first-line chemo-immunotherapy. METHOD: This multicenter retrospective study evaluated the efficacy of second line (2L) chemotherapies after progression under first-line (1L) chemo-immunotherapy, measured by overall survival (2L-OS) and progression free survival (2L-PFS). RESULTS: A total of 124 patients were included. The mean age was 63.1 years, 30.6 % of the patients were female, 72.6 % had an adenocarcinoma and 43.5 % had a poor ECOG-performance status prior to 2L initiation. Sixty-four (52.0 %) patients were considered resistant to first line chemo-immunotherapy. (1L-PFS < 6 months). In 2L treatments, 57 (46.0 %) patients received taxane monotherapy, 25 (20.1 %) taxane plus anti-angiogenic, 12 (9.7 %) platinum-based chemotherapy and 30 (24.2 %) other chemotherapy. At a median follow-up of 8.3 months (95 %CI: 7.2-10.2), post initiation of 2L treatment, the median 2L-OS was 8.1 months (95 % CI: 6.4-12.7) and the median 2L-PFS was 2.9 months (95 %CI: 2.4-3.3). Overall, the 2L-objective response and 2L-disease control rates were 16.0 %, and 42.5 %, respectively. Taxane plus anti-angiogenic and platinum rechallenge achieved longest median 2L-OS: not reached (95 %CI: 5.8-NR) and 17.6 months (95 %CI 11.6-NR), respectively (p = 0.05). Patients resistant to the 1L treatment had inferior outcomes (2L-OS 5.1 months, 2L-PFS 2.3 months) compared with 1L responders (2L-OS 12.7 months, 2L-PFS 3.2 months). CONCLUSION: In this real-life cohort, 2L chemotherapy achieved modest activity following progression under chemo-immunotherapy. 1L-resistant patients remained a refractory population, highlighting a need for new 2L strategies.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 17351950\nTitle: Phase II randomized study of daily gefitinib treatment alone or with vinorelbine every 2 weeks in patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung who failed at least 2 regimens of chemotherapy.\nAuthors: Chen YM, Liu JM, Chou TY\nJournal: Cancer\nPublication Date: 2007 May 1\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of adding chronic, intermittent, low-dose vinorelbine to gefitinib treatment for patients who had adenocarcinoma of the lung who failed>or=2 regimens of chemotherapy. METHODS: Patients were randomized into 2 arms: Oral gefitinib 250 mg daily (the G arm) or vinorelbine 15 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion on Day 1 and oral gefitinib 250 mg daily on Days 2 through 14 every 2 weeks (the GV arm). From August 2004 to October 2005, 48 patients were enrolled. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 18 through 21 nucleotide sequence analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization were performed in patients who had tumor tissue specimens available for analysis. RESULTS: After randomization, each arm had 24 patients. However, 3 patients refused vinorelbine treatment and were given gefitinib treatment only. Thus, 27 patients received G treatment, and 21 patients received GV treatment. Objective response rates were 55.6% in the G arm and 52.4% in the GV arm. All toxicities in both arms were mild. The 1-year progression-free survival rate was 57.1% in the GV arm and 21.2% in the G arm (P=.008). The median survival was 13.3 months in the G arm and 23.4 months in the GV arm (P=.1231). Three of 6 patients (50%) had an exon 19 in-frame deletion, and 2 of 10 patients had EGFR gene high polysomy or amplification (20%). CONCLUSIONS: Gefitinib was highly effective in ethnic Chinese patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung who failed previous platinum and taxane treatment. The addition of low-dose vinorelbine every 2 weeks produced a significantly better 1-year progression-free survival rate.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was an open-label, phase II study of patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) -positive and EGFR-negative advanced NSCLC with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 1. Patients received cetuximab 400 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) during 120 minutes on week 1 followed by weekly doses of cetuximab 250 mg/m2 IV during 60 minutes. A cycle was considered as 4 weeks of treatment and therapy was continued until disease progression or intolerable toxicities. The primary end point was to assess response rate. Secondary end points included an estimation of time to progression and survival. RESULTS: Patient and disease characteristics (n = 66) included EGFR-positive status (n = 60); EGFR-negative status (n = 6); number of prior regimens (one, n = 28; two, n = 27; > or = three, n = 11); male (n = 41); female (n = 25); adenocarcinoma (n = 36); and smoking status (never, n = 13; former, n = 45; current, n = 8). Grade 3/4 toxicities included acne-like rash (6.1%), anaphylactic reactions (1.5%), and diarrhea (1.5%). The response rate for all patients (n = 66) was 4.5% (95% CI, 0.9% to 12.7%) and the stable disease rate was 30.3% (95% CI, 19.6% to 42.9%). The response rate for patients with EGFR-positive tumors (n = 60) was 5% (95% CI, 1.0% to 13.9%). The median time to progression for all patients was 2.3 months (95% CI, 2.1 to 2.6 months) and median survival time was 8.9 months (95% CI, 6.2 to 12.6 months). CONCLUSION: Although the response rate with single-agent cetuximab in this heavily pretreated patient population with advanced NSCLC was only 4.5%, the disease control rates and overall survival seem comparable to that of pemetrexed, docetaxel, and erlotinib in similar groups of patients.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 34532362\nTitle: Survival benefit of immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer recurrence after completely pulmonary resection.\nAuthors: Kuroda H, Takahashi Y, Shirai S\nJournal: Annals of translational medicine\nPublication Date: 2021 Aug\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Selected patients in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) responded to the treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have the survival benefit for advanced stages or metastatic status. METHODS: We investigated whether a response to ICI monotherapy since 2016 influences the survival of NSCLC patients with recurrence after completely pulmonary resection between 2009 and 2017. Disease control rate (DCR) was calculated as complete plus partial response plus stable disease during more than 6 months. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients (mean age 67 years, range 46-79 years, 60% male) were included in the study. The most frequent histology and pathological stage were adenocarcinoma (60%) and IIB (45.7%), respectively. ICI was used at a median of second-line treatment. The DCR and median progression-free survival were 42.8% and 2.5 (95% CI: 1.6-3.4) months, respectively. The therapeutic outcome from recurrence was 47.5%. Multivariate analysis revealed a significant impact of DCR on favorable therapeutic outcome (P=0.04). A serial increase (pre- to post-surgery to ICI initiation) of C-reactive protein (CRP) and prognostic nutritional index (PNI) was associated with treatment response (both P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a response to ICI monotherapy significantly contributes to a survival benefit regardless of therapeutic lines in NSCLC patients with recurrence after completely pulmonary resection, and the therapeutic response is strongly associated with a serial increase in CRP or decrease in prognostic nutritional index.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 30685684\nTitle: Afatinib in patients with metastatic or recurrent HER2-mutant lung cancers: a retrospective international multicentre study.\nAuthors: Lai WV, Lebas L, Barnes TA\nJournal: European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)\nPublication Date: 2019 Mar\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION: HER2 mutations occur in 1-3% of lung adenocarcinomas. With increasing use of next-generation sequencing at diagnosis, more patients with HER2-mutant tumours present for treatment. Few data are available to describe the clinical course and outcomes of these patients when treated with afatinib, a pan-HER inhibitor. METHODS: We identified patients with metastatic or recurrent HER2-mutant lung adenocarcinomas treated with afatinib among seven institutions across Europe, Australia, and North America between 2009 and 2017. We determined the partial response rate to afatinib, types of HER2 mutations, duration of response, time on treatment, and survival. RESULTS: We collected information on 27 patients with stage IV or recurrent HER2-mutant lung adenocarcinomas treated with afatinib. Of 23 patients evaluable for response, three partial responses were noted (13%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4-33%). In addition, 57% of patients (13/23) had stable disease, and 30% (7/23) had progressive disease. We documented partial responses in patients with HER2 exon 20 insertions, including two with YVMA insertion and one with VAG insertion. Two patients with partial responses were previously treated with trastuzumab and pertuzumab. Median duration of response to afatinib was 6 months (range 5-10); median time on treatment was 3 months (range 1-30) and median overall survival from the date of diagnosis of metastatic or recurrent disease was 23 months (95% CI 18-53 months). CONCLUSIONS: Afatinib is modestly active in patients with HER2-mutant lung adenocarcinomas, including responses after progression on prior HER2-targeted therapies. However, investigations into the biology of HER2-mutant lung adenocarcinomas and development of better HER2-directed therapies are warranted.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Therefore, more effective treatments are still needed. Here, we report the results of a phase 2 clinical trial of adoptive cell therapy using zoledronate-expanded autologous Vgamma9Vdelta2 T-cells for treatment-refractory NSCLC. METHODS: NSCLC patients who had undergone at least two regimens of standard chemotherapy for unresectable disease or had had at least one treatment including chemotherapy or radiation for recurrent disease after surgery were enrolled in this open-label, single-arm, multicenter, phase 2 study. After preliminary testing of Vgamma9Vdelta2 T-cell proliferation, autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured with zoledronate and IL-2 to expand the Vgamma9Vdelta2 T-cells. Cultured cells (>1x10(9)) were intravenously administered every 2 weeks for six injections. The primary endpoint of this study was progression-free survival (PFS), and secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), best objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), safety and immunomonitoring. Clinical efficacy was defined as median PFS significantly >4 months. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (20 adenocarcinoma, 4 squamous cell carcinoma and 1 large cell carcinoma) were enrolled. Autologous Vgamma9Vdelta2 T-cell therapy was administered to all 25 patients, of which 16 completed the foreseen course of 6 injections of cultured cells. Median PFS was 95.0 days (95% CI 73.0 to 132.0 days); median OS was 418.0 days (179.0-479.0 days), and best overall responses were 1 partial response, 16 stable disease (SD) and 8 progressive disease. ORR and DCR were 4.0% (0.1%-20.4%) and 68.0% (46.5%-85.1%), respectively. Severe adverse events developed in nine patients, mostly associated with disease progression. In one patient, pneumonitis and inflammatory responses resulted from Vgamma9Vdelta2 T-cell infusions, together with the disappearance of a massive tumor. CONCLUSIONS: Although autologous Vgamma9Vdelta2 T-cell therapy was well tolerated and may have an acceptable DCR, this trial did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint.

Cancer & chemotherapy\nPublication Date: 2015 Nov\nAbstract: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in Japan. oxaliplatin: L-OHP, irinotecan: CPT-11, fluorouracil: 5-FU, and Leucovorin: l-LV (FOLFIRINOX) combination chemotherapy provided significant improvements in overall and progression-free survival in a phase \u2162 trial in France and in a phase \u2161 trial in Japan. As a result, this combination therapy was approved for use in Japan. We evaluated the efficacy of FOLFIRINOX in metastatic or recurrent pancreatic cancer. Between October 2014 and July 2015, 10 patients received mFOLFIRINOX as follows: 2-hour infusion of LOHP at 85 mg/m2, 2-hour infusion of l-LV at 200 mg/m2 and infusion of CPT-11 over 90 min at 150 mg/m2, followed by continuous infusion of 5-FU over 46 hours at 2,400mg/m2. Prior to the treatment, a 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor antagonist, aprepitant, and dexamethasone were given. The treatment was repeated every 2 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, discontinuation as decided by the investigators, or patient refusal. The mean age of the patients was 65.0 years (range, 59-75 years), and 4 out of 10 patients were men. Only 2 patients had no prior therapy. Nine patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0. Eight patients had metastasis and 2 had locally recurrent disease. The median number of treatment cycles was 5 (range, 1-14). The relative dose intensities of 5-FU, L-OHP and CPT-11 were 93.3% (range, 58.3-100%), 84.0% (range, 63.2-100%), and 76.0% (range, 44.4-83.3%), respectively. The major Grade 3 and 4 hematological toxicities were neutropenia (40%), leucopenia (30%), and thrombocytopenia(10%). The major Grade 2 and 3 non-hematological toxicities were diarrhea (30%), nausea (60%), and vomiting (10%). Serious adverse events occurred in 2 patients. Severe biliary tract infection causing sepsis was observed in 1 patient with a biliary stent. Overwhelming post-splenectomy infection was observed in 1 patient after distal pancreatectomy. No cases of interstitial lung disease were observed. The 6-month progression-free and overall survival rates were 59.3% and 61.7%, respectively. The overall response rate was 10%, and the disease control rate was 90%(complete response [CR], n=0; partial response [PR], n=1; stable disease [SD], n=8; progressive disease [PD], n=1). Although FOLFIRINOX is associated with increased treatment efficacy and survival outcomes, because of its severe toxicity it cannot be administered to all patients. FOLFIRINOX can be used as the standard treatment for patients with a good performance status.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

The aim of the current study was to determine a clinical profile of gefitinib-induced disease controls for patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Retrospective evaluation of the clinical characteristics of 52 lung adenocarcinoma patients, enrolled at the Zhejiang Cancer Hospital (Hangzhou, China) between October 2004 and August 2008, was undertaken. All patients received gefitinib (250 mg/day orally) until disease progression or until an unacceptable toxicity was observed. Of the 52 patients, complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) rates were 23.1% (12/52) and 57.7% (30/52), respectively. An additional 19.2% (10/52) of patients demonstrated stable disease (SD) after three months of treatment with gefitinib. Disease control was observed in the primary lesion, and tumor metastasis to the lungs, brain, adrenal glands, pleura, peritoneum, pericardium, bone and lymph nodes was identified. The one-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 74.8 and 78.0%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that female patients were associated with significantly longer survival times when compared with males (hazard ratio, 0.077; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.007-0.083; P=0.035). One-year PFS and OS rates in CR, PR and SD patients were 77.8, 73.9 and 33.3%, and 89.2, 79.8 and 33.7%, respectively, although neither difference was identified to be statistically significant. In addition, the median OS of SD patients was 12 months (95% CI, 7.2-16.8 months). Brain metastasis was the major site of disease progression (23.1%). Gefitinib treatment for patients with lung adenocarcinoma showed a marked long-term survival benefit, even in SD patients. However, further studies are required to analyze the efficacy of gefitinib in penetrating the blood-brain barrier in order to prolong PFS in patients with lung adenocarcinoma.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 21272953\nTitle: Duration of prior gefitinib treatment predicts survival potential in patients with lung adenocarcinoma receiving subsequent erlotinib.\nAuthors: Asami K, Kawahara M, Atagi S\nJournal: Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)\nPublication Date: 2011 Aug\nAbstract: PURPOSE: We investigated survival potential in patients receiving erlotinib after failure of gefitinib, focusing on response and time to progression (TTP) with gefitinib. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed lung adenocarcinoma patients who received erlotinib after experiencing progression with gefitinib. Our primary objective was to evaluate the prognostic significance of erlotinib therapy. RESULTS: A total 42 lung adenocarcinoma patients were included in this study. Overall disease control rate was 59.5% (partial response [PR], 2.4%; stable disease [SD], 57.1%). Median overall survival was 7.1 months, and median progression-free survival was 3.4 months. The number of patients who achieved PR and non-PR (SD+ progressive disease [PD]) with gefitinib were 22 (52%) and 20 (48%), respectively. Patients with PR for gefitinib showed significantly longer survival times than those with non-PR (9.2 vs. 4.7 months; p=0.014). In particular, among PR patients, those with TTP <12 months on gefitinib showed significantly longer survival times than those with TTP >/=12 months (10.3 vs. 6.4 months; p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Erlotinib may exert survival benefit for lung adenocarcinoma patients with less than 12 months of TTP of prior gefitinib who achieved PR for gefitinib.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 32953518\nTitle: Analysis of the clinical effect of osimertinib on 90 cases with advanced lung adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Gao Z, Wang W, Gu A\nJournal: Translational lung cancer research\nPublication Date: 2020 Aug\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Primary or secondary drug resistance of epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) is a new challenge in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Osimertinib is a third-generation EGFR-TKI, and its efficacy and safety in NSCLC patients with first-generation EGFR-TKI resistance, especially lung adenocarcinoma, are not yet clear. The purpose of this study was to observe the efficacy and adverse reactions of osimertinib in the treatment of patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma. METHODS: From January 2017 to December 2018, 90 patients with advanced (stage IV) lung adenocarcinoma were diagnosed in Shanghai Chest Hospital. The disease of these patients (94.4%) progressed after first-line EGFR-TKI treatment, and 43.3% of patients received third-line or beyond third-line treatment. The efficacy and adverse reactions of osimertinib treatment were observed. RESULTS: Among 90 patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma, 57 (63.3%) achieved partial response (PR), 27 (30.0%) had stable disease (SD), and 6 (6.7%) had progressive disease (PD). The objective response rate (ORR) was 63.3%, and the disease control rate (DCR) was 93.3%. The median progression-free time (mPFS) was 10.41 months (95% CI: 8.91-11.91 months), and the median overall survival (mOS) was 31.37 months (95% CI: 26.37-36.37 months). The incidence of adverse events of degree 3 and above was 7.78%. The main adverse events were diarrhea (28.9%) and rash (24.4%). After symptomatic treatment, the incidence of adverse events was significantly reduced. CONCLUSIONS: Osimertinib has a definite curative effect in the treatment of patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma, and the incidence of adverse reactions is low.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
