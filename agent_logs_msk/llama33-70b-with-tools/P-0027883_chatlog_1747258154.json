It was originally investigated for its antiviral effects, but it is now used as an anticancer therapy for various cancers.[A233135] Gemcitabine is a cytidine analog with two fluorine atoms replacing the hydroxyl on the ribose.[A233145] As a prodrug, gemcitabine is transformed into its active metabolites that work by replacing the building blocks of nucleic acids during DNA elongation, arresting tumour growth and promoting apoptosis of malignant cells.[L32960] The structure, metabolism, and mechanism of action of gemcitabine are similar to [cytarabine], but gemcitabine has a wider spectrum of antitumour activity.[A233140]\r\n\r\nGemcitabine is marketed as Gemzar and it is available as intravenous injection. It is approved by the FDA to treat advanced ovarian cancer in combination with [carboplatin], metastatic breast cancer in combination with [paclitaxel], non-small cell lung cancer in combination with [cisplatin], and pancreatic cancer as monotherapy.[L32950] It is also being investigated in other cancer and tumour types.\nCapecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers. Capecitabine is a prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to fluorouracil (antimetabolite) in the tumor, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor tissue.\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0027883-T01-IM6\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0027883\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Pancreatic Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Pancreas\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT468\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 789, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 30.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"PAAD\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis. This leads to the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-G2 phase and cancer cell death.[A263376]\nCapecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers. Capecitabine is a prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to fluorouracil (antimetabolite) in the tumor, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor tissue.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

BACKGROUND: Most patients with resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) recur within 2 years. Different survival outcomes for location-specific patterns of recurrence are reported, highlighting their prognostic value. However, a lack of understanding of postrecurrence progression and survival remains. METHODS: This retrospective analysis included surgically treated patients with PDAC at NYU Langone Health (2010-2021). Sites of recurrence were identified at the time of diagnosis and further follow-up. Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank test, and Cox regression analyses were applied to assess survival outcomes. RESULTS: Recurrence occurred in 57.3% (196/342) patients with a median time to recurrence of 11.3 months (95% CI: 12.6-16.5). The first site of recurrence was local in 43.9% of patients, liver in 23.5%, peritoneal in 8.7%, lung in 3.6%, whereas 20.4% had multiple sites of recurrence. Progression to secondary sites was observed in 11.7%. Only lung involvement was associated with significantly longer survival after recurrence compared with other sites (16.9 vs 8.49 months, P = 0.003). In local recurrence, 21 (33.3%) patients were alive after 1 year without progression to secondary sites. This was associated with a CA19-9 of <100 U/mL at the time of primary diagnosis ( P = 0.039), nodal negative disease ( P = 0.023), and well-moderate differentiation ( P = 0.042) compared with patients with progression. CONCLUSION: Except for lung recurrence, postrecurrence survival after PDAC resection is associated with poor survival. A subset of patients with local-only recurrence do not quickly succumb to systemic spread. This is associated with markers for favorable tumor biology, making them candidates for potential curative re-resections when feasible.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 37185395\nTitle: Early Recurrence after Upfront Surgery for Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Nappo G, Donisi G, Capretti G\nJournal: Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)\nPublication Date: 2023 Mar 27\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Survival after surgery for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains poor, due to early recurrence (ER) of the disease. A global definition of ER is lacking and different cut-off values (6, 8, and 12 months) have been adopted. The aims of this study were to define the optimal cut-off for the definition of ER and predictive factors for ER. METHODS: Recurrence was recorded for all consecutive patients undergoing upfront surgery for PDAC at our institute between 2010 and 2017. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were utilized, to estimate the optimal cut-off for the definition of ER as a predictive factor for poor post-progression survival (PPS). To identify predictive factors of ER, univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used. RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty one cases were retrospectively evaluated. The recurrence rate was 76.9%. ER rates were 29.0%, 37.6%, and 47.6%, when adopting 6, 8, and 12 months as cut-offs, respectively. A significant difference in median PPS was only shown between ER and late recurrence using 12 months as cut-off (p = 0.005). In the multivariate analysis, a pre-operative value of CA 19-9 > 70.5 UI/L (OR 3.10 (1.41-6.81); p = 0.005) and the omission of adjuvant treatment (OR 0.18 (0.08-0.41); p < 0.001) were significant predictive factors of ER. CONCLUSIONS: A twelve-months cut-off should be adopted for the definition of ER. Almost 50% of upfront-resected patients presented ER, and it significantly affected the prognosis. A high preoperative value of CA 19-9 and the omission of adjuvant treatment were the only predictive factors for ER.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 26781798\nTitle: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma: the impact of preneoplastic lesion pattern on survival.\nAuthors: Flattet Y, Yamaguchi T, Andrejevic-Blant S\nJournal: Bioscience trends\nPublication Date: 2015 Dec\nAbstract: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is associated with a very poor prognosis, characterized with a 5-year survival rate of only 5%. Surgery is the only curative treatment for selected patients. Nevertheless, recurrence is very frequent. Identifying prognostic factors is thus warranted. Like numerous other tumors, adenocarcinomas are preceded by preneoplastic lesions. The role and the impact of these lesions remain unclear. This study aimed to assess the impact of the preneoplastic lesion pattern and histo-morphological features, on survival after pancreatic resection. Thirty-five patients who underwent pancreatic resection for pancreatic adenocarcinoma were identified from a prospective database of a single center, between 2003 and 2008. We considered demographics, tumor characteristics and type of treatment. The major outcome was survival. Analyzes were separated into two groups, according to the preneoplastic lesions: Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN)-related carcinomas and intracanalar papillary mucinous neoplasia (IPMN)-related carcinomas. The former were more frequent, accounting for 63% (22/35). Moreover, they displayed more aggressive features, with a higher tumor stage (p = 0.01) and higher rate of positive lymph nodes (p = 0.019). Lymphatic (p = 0.009) and perinervous (p = 0.019) invasions were also more frequent. Survival was negatively influenced by PanIN preneoplastic lesions (p = 0.015), T3-4 tumor stage (p = 0.038), positive lymph nodes (p = 0.044), lymphatic (p = 0.019) and vascular (p = 0.029) invasions. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma displays different behavior according to its preneoplastic lesion. Indeed, PanIN-related adenocarcinoma showed more aggressive features and lower survival rate. Preneoplastic lesions may represent predictive factors for survival. Their role and predictive value should be investigated more thoroughly.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
