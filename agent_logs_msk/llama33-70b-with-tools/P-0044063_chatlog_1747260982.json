Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nCapecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers.

In the 2018 classification, it was a colon cancer subtype included in the adenocarcinoma, Not otherwise specified (NOS) group. A few studies have reported that colon cancers with a cribriform pattern have worse overall survival, and most of them are microsatellite stable (MSS). In this study, we evaluated CCAs based on their clinicopathologic features and microsatellite stability. We aimed to answer whether these tumors could be defined as a distinct morphologic subtype with prognostic significance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pathology reports and specimens from 449 patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRA) were re-evaluated. All subtypes were determined. To evaluate MSS status, the CCA cases were immunohistochemically stained with anti-MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 antibodies. RESULTS: CCA was present in 40.5% of cases. These cases were found to have higher rates of lymph node metastasis, lymphovascular-perineural invasion, metastasis, and advanced stage ( P < 0.05). Also, 2.7% of CCA cases were microsatellite instable (MSI). However, no statistically significant result was found regarding overall survival and progression-free survival of CCA cases with MSI. CONCLUSION: According to the findings, CRAs with comedo cribriform patterns are tumors with more aggressive features. It can be said that these tumors have a specific molecular feature related to MSS. Because this feature is important for planning adjuvant chemotherapy, it may be useful to identify cases, particularly with a cribriform comedo pattern >90%. However, because no significant difference in survival rates was found, CCAs may not need to be defined as distinct subtypes.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 21454688\nTitle: WITHDRAWN: Restoration of transforming growth factor-beta receptor II expression in colon cancer cells with microsatellite instability increases metastatic potential in vivo.\nAuthors: Liu XQ, Rajput A, Geng L\nJournal: The Journal of biological chemistry\nPublication Date: 2011 May 6\nAbstract: Microsatellite instability (MSI), which occurs in 15% of colorectal cancer, has been shown to have a lower incidence of metastasis and better patient survival rates compared with microsatellite stable colorectal cancer. However, a mechanistic understanding of the basis for this difference is very limited. Here, we show that restoration of TGFbeta signaling by re-expression of TGFbeta receptor II in MSI colon cancer cells increased PI3K/AKT activation, conferred resistance to growth factor deprivation stress-induced apoptosis, and promoted cell motility in vitro. Treatment with a potent PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) blocked the prosurvival and promotility effects of TGFbeta, indicating that TGFbeta-mediated promotion of cell survival and motility is dependent upon activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Analysis of apoptotic effectors that are affected by TGFbeta signaling indicated that Bim is an effector of TGFbeta-mediated survival. In addition, TGFbeta-induced down-regulation of E-cadherin contributed to the prosurvival effect of TGFbeta, and restoration of TGFbeta signaling in MSI colon cancer cells increased liver metastasis in an orthotopic model in vivo. Taken together, our results demonstrate that restoration of TGFbeta signaling promotes cell survival, motility, and metastatic progression in MSI colon cancer cells and indicate that TGFbeta receptor II mutations contribute to the favorable outcomes in colon cancer patients with MSI.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 37039887\nTitle: [Checkpoint inhibitors in colorectal carcinoma: are we entering a new era?].\nAuthors: Pox C\nJournal: Innere Medizin (Heidelberg, Germany)\nPublication Date: 2023 May\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Checkpoint-inhibitors have shown high response rates in some tumours such as melanomas. OBJECTIVES: This article describes the data concerning the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). CURRENT DATA: Efficacy for the use of checkpoint inhibitors in CRC has only been shown for tumours with high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) or a deficient mismatch repair system (dMMR). The proportion of patients with MSI-H/dMMR cancers is 10-12% in colon cancers and 3% in rectal cancers. In cohort studies with patients that had progressed under at least one chemotherapy a response rate of 33% could be shown for pembrolizumab and 65% for the combination nivolumab and ipilimumab. In many patients the response was long-lasting. After 2 years between 55 and 75% of patients were still alive. In a randomized study comparing first-line therapy with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy progression-free survival was much longer for the pembrolizumab group (16.5 vs. 8.2 months). In a small series of patients with MSI-H/dMMR rectal cancers treatment with dostarlimab resulted in complete remission in all patients with no regrowth during an admittedly short follow-up. A series of patients with locally advanced MSI-H/dMMR colon cancers showed a treatment response in nearly all patients with 67% experiencing complete remission. In patients with microsatellite-stable (MSS) cancers checkpoint inhibitors showed no effect, the combination with chemotherapy at most a modest effect. CONCLUSIONS: Checkpoint inhibitors are the first-choice palliative treatment in patients with MSI-H/dMMR CRC and have replaced chemotherapy as the first option. Early data show a high response rate for the neoadjuvant treatment of MSI-H/dMMR rectal and colon cancers.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

We evaluated the association between MSI and survival in this population. METHODS: We analyzed 598 patients with curatively resected stage III colon cancer treated with adjuvant FOLFOX chemotherapy. We determined MSI status using polymerase chain reaction amplification; tumors were classified as high MSI (MSI-H, >/=2 unstable markers), low MSI (MSI-L, 1 unstable marker), or microsatellite stable (MSS, no unstable marker). RESULTS: Of 598 patients, 8.4% showed MSI-H. Tumors classified as MSI-H were more commonly located in the ascending colon (54.0 vs. 27.7%, p < 0.0001) and had poorly differentiated features (32.0 vs. 8.0%, p < 0.0001). After the median follow-up of 52.8 months, 5-year disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 77.0 and 85.9%, respectively. In univariate analysis, pathologic T4 (pT4) and pathologic N2 (pN2) was associated with reduced DFS (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001, respectively) and OS (p = 0.002 and p = 0.001, respectively), whereas MSI status did not affect either DFS (p = 0.114) or OS (p = 0.525). In patients with pN2 tumors; however, MSI-H was associated with better survival compared with MSS/MSI-L; DFS and OS in patients with MSI-H/pN2 were comparable to those in patients with pN1 tumors. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with stage III colon cancer treated with adjuvant FOLFOX, pT4 and pN2 was associated with reduced survival, but MSI status alone did not affect survival.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 20043121\nTitle: Microsatellite instability at tetranucleotide repeats in sporadic colorectal cancer in Japan.\nAuthors: Yamada K, Kanazawa S, Koike J\nJournal: Oncology reports\nPublication Date: 2010 Feb\nAbstract: Most tumors of patients with Lynch syndrome and a fraction of sporadic colorectal cancers (CRCs) exhibit high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI) at mono- and dinucleotide repeat loci. A different type of instability, elevated microsatellite alterations at selected tetranucleotide repeats (EMAST) has been found in non-colonic cancers. Our previous study demonstrated that EMAST is common in sporadic CRC. Here, we focused on the relationships between EMAST and other genomic instability parameters or clinicopathological features in an unselected series of 88 sporadic CRCs. Of the tumors in the sample, 4 (4.5%) were MSI-high (MSI-H), 9 (10.2%) were MSI-low (MSI-L) and 75 (85.2%) were microsatellite stable. EMAST status was determined using 7 EMAST markers. Fifty-three (60.2%) tumors without MSI-H showed instability at >or=1 EMAST loci. All 4 MSI-H tumors showed instability at several EMAST loci. Instability profiles of MSI-H tumors at EMAST loci were more complex than those of non-MSI-H tumors. A tendency of positive association was observed between MSI-L and EMAST (P=0.023). The frequency of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for the 14 loci in EMAST-positive tumors was significantly higher than negative tumors (P=0.048). Among the clinicopathological parameters, only tumor location at the distal colon was associated with EMAST-negative tumors (P=0.0084, one-tailed). A relatively higher frequency of well-differentiated adenocarcinomas was observed in EMAST tumors as opposed to non-EMAST tumors, though the survival rate was similar. These results suggest that overlapping mechanisms that cause MSI-L, EMAST and LOH in CRCs may exist.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

The CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) levels have been monitored, with values ranging from 0.8 to 0.9 ng/ml.\n\nConsidering the patient's current status and treatment history, I believe that the likelihood of the patient being alive in the next 12 months is high.\n\n[ANSWER: A]"
