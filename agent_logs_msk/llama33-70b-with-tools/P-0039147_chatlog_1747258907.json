Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0039147-T01-IM6\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0039147\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Colorectal Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Ascending Colon\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Colon Adenocarcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT468\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 522, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 50.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"COAD\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

Using nationally representative Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data, we compared survival rates associated with colon cancer stages defined according to both AJCC systems. METHODS: Using SEER data (from January 1, 1991, through December 31, 2000), we identified 119,363 patients with colon adenocarcinoma and included all patients in two analyses by stages defined by AJCC fifth and sixth edition systems. Tumors were stratified by SEER's \"extent of disease\" and \"number of positive [lymph] nodes\" coding schemes. Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to compare overall and stage-specific 5-year survival. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Overall 5-year survival was 65.2%. According to stages defined by the AJCC fifth edition system, 5-year stage-specific survivals were 93.2% for stage I, 82.5% for stage II, 59.5% for stage III, and 8.1% for stage IV. According to stages defined by the AJCC sixth edition system, 5-year stage-specific survivals were 93.2% for stage I, 84.7% for stage IIa, 72.2% for stage IIb, 83.4% for stage IIIa, 64.1% for stage IIIb, 44.3% for stage IIIc, and 8.1% for stage IV. Under the sixth edition system, 5-year survival was statistically significantly better for patients with stage IIIa colon cancer (83.4%) than for patients with stage IIb disease (72.2%) (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The AJCC sixth edition system for colon cancer stratifies survival more distinctly than the fifth edition system by providing more substages. The association of stage IIIa colon cancer with statistically significantly better survival than stage IIb in the new system may reflect current clinical practice, in which stage III patients receive chemotherapy but stage II patients generally do not.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 15789256\nTitle: Laparoscopic colectomy for colon adenocarcinoma: an 11-year retrospective review with 5-year survival rates.\nAuthors: Jacob BP, Salky B\nJournal: Surgical endoscopy\nPublication Date: 2005 May\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic colectomy for the management of colon cancer remains a controversial therapeutic option, especially when the outcomes are compared with the historically accepted survival data and recurrence rates after open surgery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the 5-year overall and disease-free survival rates after laparoscopic colon resection for invasive colon adenocarcinoma. METHODS: A total of 129 patients underwent consecutive laparoscopic colectomies for colon adenocarcinoma (between April 1992 and 2004 January) by a single surgeon at a single institution. Records were analyzed retrospectively and follow-up data was obtained. The Student t-test, Cox regression analysis, and Kaplan-Meier survival data were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: After patients with noninvasive disease on final pathology were excluded, the study population comprised 88 patients who underwent laparoscopic colectomies for invasive colon cancer with > 2 years of follow-up. Of these cases, 81 (93%) were amenable for complete follow-up at 11years (41 women and 40 men; mean age, 76 years). Mean follow-up was 61 months. There was one perioperative death (1.2%), and the overall postoperative morbidity rate was 13.6%. The average number of lymph nodes harvested was 10.1 (+/-6). There were no port site recurrences. The Kaplan-Meier survival data were as follows for 5-year overall survival and 5-year disease-free survival, respectively stage I (n = 34) 89% and 89%; stage II (n = 22), 65% and 59%; stage III (n = 19), 72% and 67%; stages I-III combined, (n = 75), 77% and 73%. CONCLUSIONS: For this specific cohort of patients undergoing curative laparoscopic colectomies for invasive colon adenocarcinoma, the mean follow-up was > 5 years. Overall survival and disease-free survival for stage I, II, and III colon cancer as well as for stages I-III combined are favorable and comparable to historically acceptable open colectomy survival rates. Overall survival and disease-free survival after laparoscopic colectomy for invasive colon cancer is no worse, and perhaps better than, the previously reported rates for the same procedure done by an open technique.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 7670682\nTitle: Management and survival of patients with adenocarcinoma of the colon and rectum: a national survey of the Commission on Cancer.\nAuthors: Beart RW, Steele GD Jr, Menck HR\nJournal: Journal of the American College of Surgeons\nPublication Date: 1995 Sep\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: The Commission on Cancer (COC) of The American College of Surgeons periodically reviews criteria for evaluation of the care of patients with cancer related to diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation, and follow-up. The COC annually performs a national survey of practices for several cancer sites. STUDY DESIGN: Data collection forms for carcinoma of the colon and rectum were field-tested and then forwarded to participating hospitals. The study included a long-term survey to permit evaluation of five-year survival rates and a short-term survey to review current practices and time trends. Specific questions were asked concerning disease presentation, preoperative evaluation, surgical treatment, postoperative care, use of adjuvant therapy, and disease status at the last follow-up examination. RESULTS: A total of 39,502 reports from 943 hospitals were analyzed, including 12,682 patients with carcinoma of the colon diagnosed in 1983, 16,527 patients with carcinoma of the colon diagnosed in 1988, 4,597 patients with carcinoma of the rectum diagnosed in 1983; and 5,696 patients with carcinoma of the rectum diagnosed in 1988. Patterns of care, including changes in presentation, diagnostic and therapeutic management, and survival rates, are presented. Specific data showing results for various ethnic groups are also included. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of cases by anatomic site was consistent with a hypothesis of rightward migration of colon carcinoma. Colon and rectal carcinomas in African-Americans were reported in more advanced stages and with corresponding decreases in survival rates. Some patterns of nonoptimal diagnostic use were noted. The increasing use of sphincter-sparing surgical alternatives for carcinoma of the rectum was evident. Adjuvant therapy was not widely used during this period. This study suggests evolving patterns of evaluation, increased preservation of continence, and improved but varying survival among ethnic groups. It further suggests that survival as measured across these 943 hospitals may be lower than that attained at some individual centers.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
