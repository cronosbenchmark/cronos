Neoadjuvant chemotherapy permits response assessment and an opportunity to switch treatment regimens. Response measured by fludeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) correlates with clinical outcomes better than computed tomography (CT) does. This trial assessed PET-measured response rate to alternative chemotherapy in patients with a suboptimal PET response after two cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS: This phase II study enrolled patients with resectable stage IB-IIIA lung cancers (primary tumor >/= 2 cm and peak standard uptake value [SUVpeak] >/= 4.5). Patients had a pretreatment (18)F-FDG PET/CT scan before two cycles of cisplatin (or carboplatin) plus gemcitabine (squamous cell carcinoma) or pemetrexed (adenocarcinoma) and then a repeat PET/CT scan. If SUVpeak in the primary tumor decreased by at least 35%, patients continued the initial chemotherapy. Individuals with less than a 35% PET response were switched to vinorelbine plus docetaxel. Postoperative radiotherapy was recommended to all patients with positive N2 nodes. A Simon's optimal two-stage design was used to evaluate the primary end point of a PET Response in Solid Tumors-defined response rate to vinorelbine plus docetaxel in previously nonresponding patients. RESULTS: Forty patients were enrolled. Fifteen patients (38% [95% confidence interval: 38-53]) had less than a 35% decrease in SUVpeak, and 13 received vinorelbine plus docetaxel. The study met its primary end point with 10 of 15 PET metabolic responses to alternate therapy (67%). Chemotherapy toxicities never precluded surgical exploration. CONCLUSIONS: Utilizing (18)F-FDG PET/CT to assess response and change preoperative chemotherapy in nonresponding patients can improve radiographic measures of response. This adaptive approach can also be used to test new drugs, attempting to optimize perioperative chemotherapy to achieve better long-term outcomes.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 26762743\nTitle: Three-Year Follow-Up of a Randomized Phase II Trial on Refinement of Early-Stage NSCLC Adjuvant Chemotherapy with Cisplatin and Pemetrexed versus Cisplatin and Vinorelbine (the TREAT Study).\nAuthors: Kreuter M, Vansteenkiste J, Fischer JR\nJournal: Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer\nPublication Date: 2016 Jan\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION: Adjuvant chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) improves survival but is associated with significant toxicity. The Randomized Phase II Trial on Refinement of Early-Stage NSCLC Adjuvant Chemotherapy with Cisplatin and Pemetrexed versus Cisplatin and Vinorelbine (TREAT study) was designed to test the hypothesis that a protocol with reduced toxicity might improve feasibility of postoperative delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy drugs to patients with NSCLC, thereby improving compliance and, potentially, survival. METHODS: Two adjuvant regimens were evaluated for feasibility in 132 patients with NSCLC: the standard regimen of cisplatin and vinorelbine (CVb) (cisplatin 50 mg/m(2) on day 1 and day 8 and vinorelbine 25 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 every 4 weeks) and a regimen consisting of cisplatin and pemetrexed (CPx) (cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) and pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) on day 1 every 3 weeks). The primary end-point analysis showing that CPx is safe and feasible with dose delivery superior to that of CVb has already been published. Here we report the 3-year follow-up results of the secondary efficacy end points-overall, relapse-free, distant metastasis-free, and local relapse-free survival-also with regard to histologic diagnosis. RESULTS: After a median of 39 months, no significant differences in any of the outcome parameters between CVb and CPx were observed. Also, histologic diagnosis and tumor size in stage IB did not influence survival in the CPx-treated patients. Yet, Cox regression analyses showed that overall survival at 3 years was significantly correlated with feasibility and the occurrence of dose-limiting toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Although adjuvant chemotherapy with CPx is safe and characterized by less toxicity and better dose delivery than CVb, overall survival was not influenced by treatment arm in the context of this phase II trial.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with unresectable Stage III non-squamous NSCLC received two 21-day cycles of Pem 500 mg/m(2) (vitamin/folic acid supplementation and dexamethasone prophylaxis per Pem-label)+Cis 75 mg/m(2) on Day 1. Eligible patients who had not progressed continued with 2 further cycles of full-dose Pem-Cis plus concurrent RT (2 Gy/fraction, 5 days/week, 66 Gy total). Primary endpoint was the 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate. RESULTS: Of 90 patients enrolled (all treated; median age 61 years, male/female 57%/43%, ECOG performance status 0/1 66%/34%, adenocarcinoma 90%, Stage III 36%/62%), 75 (83%) completed induction CT and started concurrent CT+RT. 64 (71%) patients received all 4 CT cycles and an RT dose >/=60 Gy. The 1-year PFS rate was 51.3% (95%CI: 42.0, 60.5). Median PFS was 10.6 months (95%CI: 8.6, 17.3), median OS was 26.2 months (95%CI: 16.7, not estimable). One patient died from enteritis (treatment-related) during Cycle 4. Four patients discontinued due to treatment-related adverse events, 1 on induction CT (renal failure), 3 on concurrent CT+RT (1 hypoacusis, 2 acute esophagitis). During induction CT, 18.9% of patients reported Grade 3/4 CTCAEs, only neutropenia (2.2%) and syncope (2.2%) were reported by >1 patient. During concurrent CT+RT, 41.3% of patients reported G3/4 CTCAEs, mainly esophagitis (12.0%), neutropenia (10.7%), and leukopenia (9.3%).

A total of 30 patients with adenocarcinoma were included. Nine patients had solitary, and 21 patients had multiple BM. At evaluation after two cycles, the complete response (CR) rate, partial response (PR) rate, and stable disease (SD) for brain lesions was 0, 33.3, and 46.7%, respectively. The overall CR, PR, and SD were 0, 23.3, and 46.7%, respectively. The median time to tumour progression of BM (TTP-BM) was 6.0 months (95% CI 4.068-7.932). The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 5.0 months (95% CI 4.197-5.803) and 11.0 months (95% CI 7.398-14.602), respectively.

We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 147 patients with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma treated between January 2011 and December 2015, 100 of which were in the DP group whereas 47 were in the DP group. Main inclusion criteria were treatment-naive patients, first-line treatment with PP or DP with no molecular targeted therapy during treatment, 2-6 cycles of first-line chemotherapy with unknown status of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation, 18-75 years of age, and Karnofsky performance status score of at least 70. Prognostic factors for survival were identified by using univariate and multivariate analyses. Propensity score matching was performed to further adjust for confounding. A total of 47 pairs were successfully matched between the two groups. The median overall survival was 9.0 months in the DP group and 17.0 months in the PP group; the 1-year survival rate was 29.8 and 59.6%, respectively; the 2-year survival rate was 12.8 and 21.1%, respectively (chi=4.128, P=0.042); and median progression-free survival was 6.0 and 8.0 months, respectively (chi=4.839, P=0.028). Cox multivariate analysis showed that chemotherapy regimen and number of metastatic organs were independent factors for OS. The effect of the radiotherapy dose on the primary tumor on OS was close to statistically significant. The incidence of grade 3-4 neutropenia was more significantly reduced in the DP group than in the PP group after matching (61.7 vs. 27.7%, P=0.002), with no between-group difference for adverse effects on platelets or hemoglobin. For patients with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma and unknown EGFR mutation status, PP was more effective than DP in prolonging survival and had a less adverse effect on neutrophils.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Article #3 discusses a study comparing the clinical efficacy of pemetrexed+cisplatin (PP) versus docetaxel+cisplatin (DP) for the treatment of stage IV lung adenocarcinoma, which found that PP was more effective than DP in prolonging survival and had a less adverse effect on neutrophils.\n\nConsidering the patient's age, diagnosis, treatment, and the latest diagnosis results, as well as the information from the PUBMED search results, I will provide a final answer to the question.\n\nGiven that the patient is 63.3 years old, the cancer has not progressed according to the latest CT scan, and the treatment with cisplatin and pemetrexed has been effective, I believe that the cancer is unlikely to progress in the next 12 months.\n\n[ANSWER: B]"

Chemotherapy is one of the main treatments for advanced NSCLC. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy of chemotherapy in improving overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced NSCLC. METHODS: A literature search was conducted to identify relevant randomized controlled trials. The hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a fixed-effects model. RESULTS: A total of 15 trials involving 2,354 patients were included. The pooled HR for OS was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.78-0.93), and the pooled HR for PFS was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.69-0.87).

Accurate survival prediction is crucial for personalized treatment. This study proposed a machine learning-based approach for survival prediction in NSCLC patients. METHODS: The study included 1,024 NSCLC patients from the SEER database. Seven clinical features, including age, sex, stage, and histology, were selected as input variables. A random Forest algorithm was used for survival prediction. RESULTS: The model achieved an accuracy of 83.2% in the training dataset and 80.5% in the testing dataset. The importance of the input variables was ranked as follows: stage (34.5%), age (23.1%), histology (17.4%), and sex (12.3%). CONCLUSION: The proposed machine learning-based approach can accurately predict the survival of NSCLC patients. The results can help clinicians make personalized treatment decisions and improve patient outcomes.\n\nBased on the provided information and the PUBMED search results, I will provide a final answer to the question.\n\nGiven that the patient is 63.7 years old and has experienced recurrence and progression of cancer, I believe that the patient's survival rate is poor due to the advanced stage of the disease and the inconsistent results of the diagnostic procedures.\n\n[ANSWER: B]"

Before developing into invasive stages, LUAD undergoes pre-invasive stages of adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), where surgical resection gives an excellent 5-year survival rate. Given the dramatic decline of prognosis from pre-invasive to invasive stages, a deeper understanding of key molecular changes driving the progression of LUAD is highly needed. METHODS: In this study, we performed whole-exome sequencing and RNA sequencing on surgically resected 24 AIS, 74 MIA, 99 LUAD specimens, and their adjacent paired normal tissues. Survival data were obtained by follow-up after surgery. Key molecular events were found by comparing the gene expression profiles of tumors with different stages. Finally, to measure the level of imbalance between tumor intrinsic growth potential and immune microenvironment, a tumor progressive (TP) index was developed to predict tumor progression and patients' survival outcome and validated by external datasets. RESULTS: As tumors progressed to more invasive stages, they acquired higher growth potential, mutational frequency of tumor suppressor genes, somatic copy number alterations, and tumor mutation burden, along with suppressed immune function. To better predict tumor progression and patients' outcome, TP index were built to measure the imbalance between tumor intrinsic growth potential and immune microenvironment. Patients with a higher TP index had significantly worse recurrence-free survival [Hazard ratio (HR), 10.47; 95% CI, 3.21-34.14; p < 0.0001] and overall survival (OS) [Hazard ratio (HR), 4.83e8; 95% CI, 0-Inf; p = 0.0013]. We used The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-LUAD dataset for validation and found that patients with a higher TP index had significantly worse OS (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.83-1.45; p = 0.048), demonstrating the prognostic value of the TP index for patients with LUAD. CONCLUSIONS: The imbalance of tumor intrinsic growth potential and immune function orchestrate the progression of LUAD, which can be measured by TP index. Our study provided new insights into predicting survival of patients with LUAD and new target discovery for LUAD through assessing the imbalance between tumor intrinsic growth potential and immune function.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 37726197\nTitle: Endometrial adenocarcinoma recurring in the lung: impact of molecular profile and role of local therapies on prognosis.\nAuthors: Luzarraga Aznar A, Bebia V, Lopez-Gil C\nJournal: International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society\nPublication Date: 2023 Oct 2\nAbstract: OBJECTIVES: The objective of our study was to describe the characteristics of patients with endometrial cancer diagnosed with a first recurrence involving the lung, and to describe the prognostic role of the molecular profile. We also aimed to describe the prognostic outcomes after local treatment of recurrence (resection of lung metastases or stereotactic body radiation therapy) in a group of patients with isolated lung recurrence. METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-center study between June 1995 and July 2021. The study included patients diagnosed with a first recurrence of endometrial cancer involving the lung. We defined two groups of patients: patients with isolated lung recurrence (confined to the lung) and patients with multisystemic recurrence (in the lung and other locations). RESULTS: Among 1413 patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer in stage IA to IVA of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 2009, 64 (4.5%) patients had a first recurrence involving the lung. Of these, 15 (39.1%) were of a non-specific molecular profile, 16 (25%) were p53-abnormal, 15 (23.4%) were mismatch-repair deficient, and 0% POLE-mutated. P53-abnormal patients had the shortest 3 year progression-free survival after recurrence and those with mismatch-repair deficient had the longest 3 year progression-free survival (14.3% (range; 1.6-40.3) and 47.6% (range; 9.1-79.5) respectively, p=0.001). We found no differences on overall survival after recurrence by molecular profile. Thirty-one of 64 (48.4%) patients had an isolated recurrence in the lung, and 16 (25%) patients received local treatment. When comparing patients with isolated lung recurrence, locally treated patients had a longer median progression-free survival than patients treated systemically (41.9 (range, 15.4-NA) vs 7.8 (range, 7.2-10.6) months respectively, p=0.029), a complete response rate of 80% for stereotactic body radiation therapy and a complete resection of 90.9% for surgery. CONCLUSION: Although few patients will benefit from local treatment (stereotactic body radiation therapy or resection) after a recurrence involving the lung, local therapies might be considered as an option in oligometastatic lung recurrences as they achieve high local control rates and better oncological outcomes than systemic treatment alone.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 36016532\nTitle: A novel metabolic-immune related signature predicts prognosis and immunotherapy response in lung adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Tang X, Qi C, Zhou H\nJournal: Heliyon\nPublication Date: 2022 Aug\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most frequent types of lung cancer, with a high mortality and recurrence rate. This study aimed to design a RiskScore to predict the prognosis and immunotherapy response of LUAD patients due to a lack of metabolic and immune-related prognostic models. METHODS: To identify prognostic genes and generate a RiskScore, we conducted differential gene expression analysis, bulk survival analysis, Lasso regression analysis, and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis using TCGA-LUAD as a training subset. GSE31210 and GSE50081 were used as validation subsets to validate the constructed RiskScore. Following that, we explored the connection between RiskScore and clinicopathological characteristics, immune cells infiltration, and immunotherapy. In addition, we investigated into RiskScore's biological roles and constructed a Nomogram model. RESULTS: A RiskScore was identified consisting of five genes (DKK1, CCL20, NPAS2, GNPNAT1 and MELTF). In the RiskScore-high group, LUAD patients showed decreased overall survival rates and shorter progression-free survival. Multiple clinicopathological characteristics and immune cells infiltration in TME, in particular, have been linked to RiskScore. Of note, RiskScore-related genes have been implicated to substance metabolism, carcinogenesis, and immunological pathways, among other things. Finally, the C-index of the RiskScore-based Nomogram model was 0.804 (95% CI: 0.783-0.825), and time-dependent ROC predicted probabilities of 1-, 3- and 5-year survival for LUAD patients were 0.850, 0.848 and 0.825, respectively. CONCLUSION: The RiskScore, which integrated metabolic and immunological features with DKK1, CCL20, NPAS2, GNPNAT1, and MELTF, could reliably predict prognosis and immunotherapy response in LUAD patients. Moreover, the RiskScore-based Nomogram model had a promising clinical application.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
