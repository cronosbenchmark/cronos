The records of 224 consecutive patients with pathological stage IA after radical surgery were reviewed retrospectively. Overall 1, 3 and 5-year survival rates were 89%, 76%, and 66%. Nearly half of the deaths were unrelated to the original cancer. There was no difference in survival attributable to preoperative pulmonary function, age at operation, or extent of resection. However, patients with limited resections had a higher rate of local recurrence. Survival was better with a smaller size of tumor (= 2 cm), in the female sex, and in cases of bronchoalveolar adenocarcinoma.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 29058973\nTitle: Post-recurrence survival analysis of stage I non-small-cell lung cancer.\nAuthors: Lee K, Kim HR, Kim DK\nJournal: Asian cardiovascular & thoracic annals\nPublication Date: 2017 Nov\nAbstract: Background The aim of this retrospective study was to review recurrence patterns of stage I non-small-cell lung cancer and identify prognostic factors for post-recurrence survival. Methods Among 940 patients with pathological stage I non-small-cell lung cancer who underwent curative resection, 261 experienced a recurrence; of these, 188 had adenocarcinoma and 62 had squamous cell carcinoma. Oligo-recurrence was defined as 1-3 recurrent lesions restricted to a single organ. Potentially curative local treatment included surgery, stereotactic radiotherapy, and photodynamic therapy. Results The median follow-up duration was 65 months (range 4-186 months). The most common site of recurrence was the lung in 145 patients, followed by mediastinal lymph nodes in 49, pleura in 30, and brain in 27. Local treatment for recurrent tumors included surgery in 59 patients, stereotactic radiotherapy in 46, photodynamic therapy in 2, and other radiotherapy in 41. Seventy-eight patients received chemotherapy only, and 35 received conservative treatment. Among 125 patients who were evaluated for an epidermal growth factor receptor gene mutation, 31 were treated with epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The 3- and 5-year post-recurrence survival rates were 49.1% and 33.8%, respectively. Age at recurrence, adenocarcinoma cell type, disease-free interval, epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment, and potentially curative local treatment were independent prognostic factors for survival in multivariate analysis. Conclusions Local treatment for recurrence should be considered in selected candidates, and use of epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor I is reasonable if an epidermal growth factor receptor mutation is detected.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 35040362\nTitle: Prognostic role of preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen level in part-solid lung adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Yamanashi K, Hamaji M, Murakami K\nJournal: Asian cardiovascular & thoracic annals\nPublication Date: 2022 May\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Part-solid lung adenocarcinoma appears as a heterogeneous subgroup, and its surgical management is controversial. This study aimed to elucidate whether preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen, a time-honored tumor marker, can be used as a prognostic factor that contributes to its management. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients with clinical-T1a-cN0M0 part-solid adenocarcinoma who underwent surgical resection between January 2011 and December 2015 at two institutions. RESULTS: Overall, 288 patients were identified. The median age was 69 years with 176 patients (61%) being female. The median follow-up time was 5.6 years. Lymph node metastases were found in 6 (15%) of 41 patients with elevated carcinoembryonic antigen levels, while 10 (4.0%) of 247 patients had normal carcinoembryonic antigen levels (P = 0.016). The 5-year overall survival rates in patients with normal and elevated carcinoembryonic antigen levels were 96.9% and 87.2%, respectively (P = 0.006), and the 5-year relapse-free survival rates were 91.8% and 62.8%, respectively (P < 0.001). The multivariable analysis revealed that preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen level was a significant prognostic factor for relapse-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.63-5.25, P < 0.001). Among the patients with elevated carcinoembryonic antigen levels, the 5-year overall survival rates in those undergoing lobar resection and segmentectomy were 87.0% and 88.9%, respectively (P = 0.59), and the 5-year relapse-free survival rates were 61.7% and 66.7%, respectively (P = 0.84). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen level appears to be an important predictor of postoperative survival outcomes in early-stage part-solid adenocarcinoma. Further studies are required to optimize management of patients with elevated preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels, although segmentectomy appeared acceptable in those patients.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

It was generated by grafting the variable sequences of a very high-affinity mouse antihuman PD-1 antibody onto a human IgG4-kappa isotype containing a stabilizing S228P Fc mutation.[A18829] It contains 32 cysteine residues and the complete folded molecule includes 4 disulfide linkages as interchain bonds and 23 interchain bonds.[F136] It was developed by Merck & Co and first approved for the treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma by the FDA on September 4, 2014,[L2954] becoming the first approved therapy against PD-1.[A7624] In the time since its initial approval, pembrolizumab has been granted approval in the treatment of a wide variety of cancers.[L38934,L43257]\nLenvatinib: Lenvatinib is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor that inhibits the kinase activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4). Lenvatinib also inhibits other RTKs that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4; the platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR\u03b1), KIT, and RET. These receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) located in the cell membrane play a central role in the activation of signal transduction pathways involved in the normal regulation of cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis and differentiation, and in pathogenic angiogenesis, lymphogenesis, tumour growth and cancer progression. In particular, VEGF has been identified as a crucial regulator of both physiologic and pathologic angiogenesis and increased expression of VEGF is associated with a poor prognosis in many types of cancers.\r\n\r\nLenvatinib is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioactive iodine (RAI)-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. Most patients with thyroid cancer have a very good prognosis with treatment (98% 5 year survival rate) involving surgery and hormone therapy. However, for patients with RAI-refractory thyroid cancer, treatment options are limited and the prognosis is poor, leading to a push for the development of more targeted therapies such as lenvatinib.\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: timeline0.txt] included in your context\nAGE: 65.322, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT, HAS_CANCER: Yes, PROCEDURE_TYPE: CT scan, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 65.322, diagnosis > progression --> CT scan reveals cancer has NOT progressed.\nAGE: 65.322, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), CT, TUMOR_SITE: Lung, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 65.350, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: PET, HAS_CANCER: Yes, PROCEDURE_TYPE: PET, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: Yes, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 65.350, diagnosis > progression --> PROGRESSION: N, PROCEDURE_TYPE: PET, \nAGE: 65.350, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), PET, TUMOR_SITE: Lung, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, HEAD: Yes, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: No, \nAGE: 65.383, diagnosis > cancer_presence --> HAS CANCER: Yes, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, HAS_CANCER: Yes, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, SUBTYPE: HasCancer, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 65.383, diagnosis > progression --> PROGRESSION: N, PROCEDURE_TYPE: MR, \nAGE: 65.383, diagnosis > tumor_sites --> SOURCE: Radiology Reports (NLP), MR, TUMOR_SITE: Other, PELVIS: No, OTHER: No, HEAD: No, ABDOMEN: No, CHEST: Yes, \nAGE: 65.407, samples > clinical_sample --> SAMPLE_ID: P-0041506-T01-IM6, PATIENT_ID: P-0041506, CANCER_TYPE: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, SAMPLE_TYPE: Primary, SAMPLE_CLASS: Tumor, METASTATIC_SITE: Not Applicable, PRIMARY_SITE: Lung, CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED: Lung Adenocarcinoma, GENE_PANEL: IMPACT468, SAMPLE_COVERAGE: 785, TUMOR_PURITY: 30.0, ONCOTREE_CODE: LUAD, MSI_COMMENT: MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).
