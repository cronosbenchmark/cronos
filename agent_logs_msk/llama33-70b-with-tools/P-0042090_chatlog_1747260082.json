METHODS: A total of 128 lung adenocarcinoma patients with MPE were randomly divided into two groups. Patients in the treatment group were treated with pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2), i.v., d 1, cisplatin intracavitary administration with a total dose of 75 mg/m(2), d 2, 5 and 8, and endostar intracavitary administration 45 mg, d 1, 4 and 7. Patients in the control group were treated with chemotherapy alone (pemetrexed and cisplatin and mode of administration were the same as for the treatment group. RESULTS: The effective rates (ER) of the treatment group and control group were 81.82 and 64.52%, respectively (x(2)=4.906, p=0.027). The MPE control rates (DCRs) were 93.94 and 79.03%, respectively (x(2)=6.168, p=0.013). The control rate of the treatment group was higher compared with the control group (p<0.05), especially during the first period when it was 54.55% (p=0.019); in addition, the recurrence rate was lower (9.68 vs 30.61%, p=0.005). Dyspnea, mood and overall health improved significantly in the treatment group patients. No statistically significant differences in side effects between the groups were noticed. CONCLUSION: Intracavity endostar combined with intracavitary and i.v. pemetrexed and cisplatin had a significant effect on advanced MPE of lung adenocarcinoma. In addition, the quality of life (QoL) was significantly improved and the side effects were tolerable.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 27555784\nTitle: Efficacy of cisplatin/pemetrexed with bevacizumab to treat advanced lung adenocarcinoma with different drive genes: case report and literature review.\nAuthors: Wang H, Zhu H, Kong L\nJournal: OncoTargets and therapy\nPublication Date: 2016\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy has become the first-line therapy in advanced nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, few studies have focused on cisplatin/pemetrexed with bevacizumab as the first-line therapy to treat advanced nonsquamous NSCLC. Importantly, whether the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements can influence the efficacy of bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy is very interesting. Herein, we report three cases with different types of gene drives in advanced nonsquamous NSCLC. CASE PRESENTATION: In the first case, a patient presented with wild-type EGFR and negative ALK rearrangement. In the second case, a patient presented with wild-type EGFR and positive ALK rearrangement. In the third case, a patient presented with negative ALK rearrangement and mutated EGFR in exon 19. CONCLUSION: We speculate that bevacizumab in combination with cisplatin/pemetrexed as the first-line therapy is well tolerated and results in a clinically meaningful treatment benefit, irrespective of the gene drive type in advanced nonsquamous NSCLC. However, more data are needed to confirm the relationship.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 31285955\nTitle: Randomized phase II study of pemetrexed-cisplatin or docetaxel-cisplatin plus thoracic intensity-modulated radiation therapy in patients with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Su SF, Li M, Geng YC\nJournal: American journal of cancer research\nPublication Date: 2019\nAbstract: Systemic chemotherapy is the standard treatment modality for stage IV lung adenocarcinoma patients with EGFR wild-type or unknown mutation status. Recent years, there is increasing evidence showed that selected patients with stage IV disease could benefit from aggressive thoracic radiotherapy. Either pemetrexed or docetaxel, combined with cisplatin, can be used for patients with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma. However, no prospective trials have confirmed that Pem-Cis was superior to Doc-Cis in lung adenocarcinoma. In this randomized phase 2 trial, we evaluated survival outcomes, and toxicity of Pemetrexed-Cisplatin (arm A) or Docetaxel-Cisplatin (arm B) with concurrent IMRT to the primary tumor for stage IV lung adenocarcinoma patients with EGFR wild-type or unknown mutation status. Totally, 101 patients were randomly assigned (50 in arm A and 51 in arm B). Using an intention-to-treat analysis, one-year survival rates were 72.0% and 52.9%, respectively (P=0.020). Progression-free survival was also significantly improved in the arm A (median, 12.6 v 7.5 months, P=0.013). The incidence and severity of acute pneumonitis and esophagitis was similar between two arms. Although more of grade 3 or 4 anemia and thrombocytopenia in arm A, and higher rates grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, and leukopenia were observed in arm B. Pem-Cis first-line chemotherapy with concurrent radiation therapy for stage IV lung adenocarcinoma patients with EGFR wild-type or unknown mutation status represents a potential treatment option with acceptable toxicity and high overall survival rates.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

This study aims to construct a risk model to guide immunotherapy in LUAD patients effectively. MATERIALS AND METHODS: LUAD Bulk RNA-seq data for the construction of a model, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data (GSE203360) for cell cluster analysis, and microarray data (GSE31210) for validation were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. We used the Seurat R package to filter and process scRNA-seq data. Sample clustering was performed in the ConsensusClusterPlus R package. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between two groups were mined by the Limma R package. MCP-counter, CIBERSORT, ssGSEA, and ESTIMATE were employed to evaluate immune characteristics. Stepwise multivariate analysis, Univariate Cox analysis, and Lasso regression analysis were conducted to identify key prognostic genes and were used to construct the risk model. Key prognostic gene expressions were explored by RT-qPCR and Western blot assay. RESULTS: A total of 27 immune cell marker genes associated with prognosis were identified for subtyping LUAD samples into clusters C3, C2, and C1. C1 had the longest overall survival and highest immune infiltration among them, followed by C2 and C3. Oncogenic pathways such as VEGF, EFGR, and MAPK were more activated in C3 compared to the other two clusters. Based on the DEGs among clusters, we confirmed seven key prognostic genes including CPA3, S100P, PTTG1, LOXL2, MELTF, PKP2, and TMPRSS11E. Two risk groups defined by the seven-gene risk model presented distinct responses to immunotherapy and chemotherapy, immune infiltration, and prognosis. The mRNA and protein level of CPA3 was decreased, while the remaining six gene levels were increased in clinical tumor tissues. CONCLUSION: Immune cell markers are effective in clustering LUAD samples into different subtypes, and they play important roles in regulating the immune microenvironment and cancer development. In addition, the seven-gene risk model may serve as a guide for assisting in personalized treatment in LUAD patients.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 33485660\nTitle: Surgery for pre- and minimally invasive lung adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Zhang Y, Ma X, Shen X\nJournal: The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery\nPublication Date: 2022 Feb\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE: Adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) are the pre- and minimally invasive forms of lung adenocarcinoma. We aimed to investigate safety results and survival outcomes following different types of surgical resection in a large sample of patients with AIS/MIA. METHODS: Medical records of patients with lung AIS/MIA who underwent surgery between 2012 and 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical characteristics, surgical types and complications, recurrence-free survival, and overall survival were investigated. RESULTS: A total of 1644 patients (422 AIS and 1222 MIA) were included. The overall surgical complication rate was significantly lower in patients receiving wedge resection (1.0%), and was comparable between patients undergoing segmentectomy (3.3%) or lobectomy (5.6%). Grade >/= 3 complications occurred in 0.1% of patients in the wedge resection group, and in a comparable proportion of patients in the segmentectomy group (1.5%) and the lobectomy group (1.5%). There was no lymph node metastasis. The 5-year recurrence-free survival rate was 100%. The 5-year overall survival rate in the entire cohort was 98.8%, and was comparable among the wedge resection group (98.8%), the segmentectomy group (98.2%), and the lobectomy group (99.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Sublobar resection, especially wedge resection without lymph node dissection, may be the preferred surgical procedure for patients with AIS/MIA. If there are no risk factors, postoperative follow-up intervals may be extended. These implications should be validated in further studies.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 37619407\nTitle: Stepwise progression of invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma based on radiological and biological characteristics.\nAuthors: Goto E, Takamochi K, Kishikawa S\nJournal: Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)\nPublication Date: 2023 Oct\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION: Invasive mucinous lung adenocarcinoma (IMA) has unique radiological findings and pathological characteristics. IMA is classified into solitary and pneumonic types; however, it is unclear whether these are biologically identical. METHODS: A single-center retrospective analysis was performed for 70 IMA patients (solitary type [n = 38] and pneumonic type [n = 32]) who underwent pulmonary resection between January 2010 and December 2018. We compared clinical and biological characteristics between the two types. RESULTS: The frequencies of genetic alternations such as EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, GNAS, ERBB2, TP53, NRG1, and MET were not different. Immunohistochemically, expression of MUC1 was significantly more common in the pneumonic type (5.0% versus 20.0%, p = 0.01) and diffuse MUC6 positive in the solitary type (39.0% versus 13.0%, p = 0.02). We further classified solitary types into those with or without ground-glass opacity (GGO) and pneumonic types into those with or without crazy-paving appearance (CPA), and evaluated their surgical outcomes. Five-year overall survival and relapse free survival rates were 95.8%/86.6%, 64.3%/70.7%, 74.6%/68.9%, and 50.0%/28.6% in patients with solitary type with GGO, solitary type without GGO, pneumonic type without CPA, and pneumonic type with CPA, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: There were no differences in genetic alternations; however, mucin expression pattern was different. Surgical outcomes were different according to the presence of GGO in the solitary type and the presence of CPA in the pneumonic type. These findings suggested a stepwise progression from solitary to pneumonic IMA.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

METHODS: A total of 1,064 patients who underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic pulmonectomy were included. Variable screening was performed using the random forest algorithm and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator approaches. The mixed cure model was used to identify factors affecting patient cure and survival, and a sequential analysis was performed on 5%, 10%, and 20% of the presentational subtype concurrently. A receiver operating characteristics curve was used to determine the best model and construct a nomogram to predict the cure rate. RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 58 (range: 3-115) months. Results from the cure part of the mixed model indicated that the predominant subtype, presentational subtype, and tumor diameter were the main prognostic factors affecting cure rate. Therefore, the nomogram to predict the cure rate was constructed based on these factors. The survival part indicated that the predominant subtype was the only factor that influenced recurrence and metastasis. A sequential analysis of the presentational subtype showed it had no significant effect on survival (P > 0.05). Regardless of the recording mode, no significant improvement was observed in the model's discriminative ability. Only a few postoperative pathological specimens showed lymphovascular invasion (LVI); however, the survival curve suggested a significant effect on patient survival. CONCLUSIONS: After excluding the existence of long-term survivors, the predominant tumor subtype was determined to be the only factor influencing recurrence and metastasis. Although LVI is rare in stage IA lung adenocarcinoma, its significance cannot be discounted in terms of determining patient prognosis.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 23786153\nTitle: Identification of intravascular tumor microenvironment features predicting the recurrence of pathological stage I lung adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Kaseda K, Ishii G, Aokage K\nJournal: Cancer science\nPublication Date: 2013 Sep\nAbstract: Histological vascular invasion (VI) by tumors is reportedly a risk factor influencing recurrence or survival after surgical treatment; however, few studies have evaluated which VI features affect recurrence or survival. The objective of this study was to evaluate how VI features affect recurrence in lung adenocarcinoma patients. We selected 106 patients with pathological stage I lung adenocarcinoma who showed VI and examined the properties of intravascular tumors associated with recurrence. First we investigated the relationship between the frequency of VI in a histological cross-section and the incidence of recurrence; however, a significant impact was not observed. Microscopic examination revealed the intravascular tumors were composed of not only cancer cells but also non-cancerous cells. To examine whether the characteristics of intravascular cancer cells and/or non-cancerous cells have prognostic value, we examined the expression levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related markers in cancer cells and the numbers of infiltrating non-cancerous cells, including macrophages, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. High levels of E-cadherin expression in the intravascular cancer cells were significant predictors of recurrence (P = 0.004), whereas the expressions of CD44, CD44 variant 6, and vimentin were not. Large numbers of intravascular CD204(+) macrophages (P = 0.016), CD34(+) microvessels (P = 0.007), and alpha-smooth muscle actin (+) fibroblasts (P = 0.033) were also significant predictors of recurrence. Our results indicated VI with abundant stromal cell infiltrates might be a predictor of recurrence and suggested the tumor microenvironment created by cancer cells and stromal cells within the blood vessel may play an important role during the metastatic process.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 37381717\nTitle: Factors influencing postoperative recurrence of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer.\nAuthors: Akcam TI, Tekneci AK, Ergin TM\nJournal: Acta chirurgica Belgica\nPublication Date: 2024 Apr\nAbstract: PURPOSE: This study aims to explain the factors that may influence recurrence after surgical resection for early non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: A retrospective analysis was made of 302 patients who underwent lung resection for stage I-IIA NSCLC in our clinic between January 2014 and August 2021. RESULTS: The recurrence rate was higher in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) than in those with adenocarcinoma (AC) (p = 0.004). Disease-free survival (DFS) was shorter in SCC (p = 0.004). According to histopathological subtypes, the presence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI), vascular invasion (VI), visceral pleural invasion (VPI) and tumor spread through air spaces (STAS) caused an increased risk of recurrence ((p = 0.004), (p = 0.001), (p = 0.047), (p = < 0.001)) and shorter DFS ((p = 0.002), (p = < 0.001), (p = 0.038), (p = < 0.001)). LVI and VI was more common in patients with distant recurrence (p = 0.020, p = 0.002), while the STAS was more common with locoregional recurrence (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: The presence of LVI, VI, VPI, and STAS are negative risk factors for recurrence and DFS in all patients and in patients with AC. In patients with SCC, the diagnosis of SCC itself and the presence of STAS were risk factors for recurrence and DFS. Moreover, the risk of distant recurrence is higher in the presence of LVI or VI, and the risk of locoregional recurrence in the presence of STAS is higher.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

This study aims to construct a risk model to guide immunotherapy in LUAD patients effectively. MATERIALS AND METHODS: LUAD Bulk RNA-seq data for the construction of a model, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data (GSE203360) for cell cluster analysis, and microarray data (GSE31210) for validation were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. We used the Seurat R package to filter and process scRNA-seq data. Sample clustering was performed in the ConsensusClusterPlus R package. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between two groups were mined by the Limma R package. MCP-counter, CIBERSORT, ssGSEA, and ESTIMATE were employed to evaluate immune characteristics. Stepwise multivariate analysis, Univariate Cox analysis, and Lasso regression analysis were conducted to identify key prognostic genes and were used to construct the risk model. Key prognostic gene expressions were explored by RT-qPCR and Western blot assay. RESULTS: A total of 27 immune cell marker genes associated with prognosis were identified for subtyping LUAD samples into clusters C3, C2, and C1. C1 had the longest overall survival and highest immune infiltration among them, followed by C2 and C3. Oncogenic pathways such as VEGF, EFGR, and MAPK were more activated in C3 compared to the other two clusters. Based on the DEGs among clusters, we confirmed seven key prognostic genes including CPA3, S100P, PTTG1, LOXL2, MELTF, PKP2, and TMPRSS11E. Two risk groups defined by the seven-gene risk model presented distinct responses to immunotherapy and chemotherapy, immune infiltration, and prognosis. The mRNA and protein level of CPA3 was decreased, while the remaining six gene levels were increased in clinical tumor tissues. CONCLUSION: Immune cell markers are effective in clustering LUAD samples into different subtypes, and they play important roles in regulating the immune microenvironment and cancer development. In addition, the seven-gene risk model may serve as a guide for assisting in personalized treatment in LUAD patients.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 37619407\nTitle: Stepwise progression of invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma based on radiological and biological characteristics.\nAuthors: Goto E, Takamochi K, Kishikawa S\nJournal: Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)\nPublication Date: 2023 Oct\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION: Invasive mucinous lung adenocarcinoma (IMA) has unique radiological findings and pathological characteristics. IMA is classified into solitary and pneumonic types; however, it is unclear whether these are biologically identical. METHODS: A single-center retrospective analysis was performed for 70 IMA patients (solitary type [n = 38] and pneumonic type [n = 32]) who underwent pulmonary resection between January 2010 and December 2018. We compared clinical and biological characteristics between the two types. RESULTS: The frequencies of genetic alternations such as EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, GNAS, ERBB2, TP53, NRG1, and MET were not different. Immunohistochemically, expression of MUC1 was significantly more common in the pneumonic type (5.0% versus 20.0%, p = 0.01) and diffuse MUC6 positive in the solitary type (39.0% versus 13.0%, p = 0.02). We further classified solitary types into those with or without ground-glass opacity (GGO) and pneumonic types into those with or without crazy-paving appearance (CPA), and evaluated their surgical outcomes. Five-year overall survival and relapse free survival rates were 95.8%/86.6%, 64.3%/70.7%, 74.6%/68.9%, and 50.0%/28.6% in patients with solitary type with GGO, solitary type without GGO, pneumonic type without CPA, and pneumonic type with CPA, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: There were no differences in genetic alternations; however, mucin expression pattern was different. Surgical outcomes were different according to the presence of GGO in the solitary type and the presence of CPA in the pneumonic type. These findings suggested a stepwise progression from solitary to pneumonic IMA.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 30549039\nTitle: The genomic alterations of lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma can explain the differences of their overall survival rates.\nAuthors: Meng F, Zhang L, Ren Y\nJournal: Journal of cellular physiology\nPublication Date: 2019 Jul\nAbstract: In the US, lung carcinoma accounted for over 150,000 deaths in 2018 and the advances in increasing survival rates are still limited. In this study, we investigated the cohorts with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) or lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) from The Cancer Genome Atlas to figure out the risk factors and genomic alterations that affected their prognosis. The histoclinical factors that differed between LUAD and LUSC were identified and the risk factors affecting the overall survival were figured out for both LUAD and LUSC. Next, the patterns of nucleotides substitutions and the mutational signatures were extracted to illustrate whether different mutational processes performed for them. Finally, the genes that had different frequencies of mutation were identified. LUAD and LUSC presented differences in histoclinical factors including age at the time of diagnosis, sex, smoking history, pathological T classification, and overall survival. This was caused by the distinct genomic alterations including the transition-to-transversion ratios, mutational signatures, and the frequently mutated genes. We proposed that the mutational signature associated with aging could be used to predict the prognosis of patients with LUAD. On the other hand, the AID/APOBEC family was associated with the prognosis of LUSC. Finally, SNTG1 and LRRK2 might be important in LUAD and LUSC, respectively.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
