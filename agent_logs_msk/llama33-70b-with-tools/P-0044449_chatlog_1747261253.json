The patient was initially diagnosed with rectal adenocarcinoma at age 58.100. \n\nAt age 60.596, a CT scan revealed that the cancer had not progressed. However, at age 60.820, another CT scan indicated that the cancer had progressed, with tumor sites identified in the lung. Subsequent PET scans at ages 60.919 and 60.932 showed progression and the presence of cancer, with tumor sites in the lung and head. \n\nLater, at age 61.069, a PET scan showed an indeterminate result for cancer presence and progression, with tumor sites in the liver and head. At age 61.081, an MR scan also showed an indeterminate result for progression, with tumor sites in the liver. \n\nMost recently, at age 61.319, a CT scan revealed that the cancer had not progressed, with tumor sites in the liver, pelvis, abdomen, and chest. The CEA lab test at this age showed a value of 1.4000 ng/ml.\n\nGiven this information, it's challenging to predict with certainty whether the cancer will progress in the next 3 months without current diagnostic data. However, considering the patient's history of both progression and stable disease periods, it's reasonable to assume that close monitoring and regular diagnostic assessments are crucial for early detection of any potential progression.\n\n[ANSWER: A]"

in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nYttrium Y-90: Yttrium 90 has been investigated for the treatment of Colon Cancer and Colorectal Cancer.\n]\n"

However, the risk of adenoma recurrence and optimal surveillance is not well defined. The objective of this study was to characterize the timing and frequency of rectal adenoma recurrence after removal by transanal endoscopic surgery and identify recurrence risk factors. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of a large, single-center academic institution in Vancouver, BC, Canada. Consecutive patients between May 1, 2007 and September 30, 2016 with pathology-confirmed rectal adenoma treated by primary excision with transanal endoscopic surgery and at least 1 year of confirmed endoscopic follow-up were included. Main outcome measures were recurrence rates following TEM as well as risk factors for recurrence. RESULTS: 297 patients met inclusion criteria. The mean age of patients was 66.5 +/- 11.5 years and 57.9% were male. Median follow-up was 623 (range 56-3841) days. A total of 62 recurrences occurred in 41 patients (13.8% of study population). Recurrences were managed with repeat transanal endoscopic surgery or endoscopic resection 67.7% and 25.8% of the time, respectively. Radical resection was required for adenocarcinoma in 4 patients. Recurrence-free survival rates were 93.4% at 1 year, 86.2% at 2 years, and 73.1% at 5 years. After adjusting for individual surgeons, adenoma height, size > 3 cm, high-grade dysplasia, positive margins, and management of the rectal defect, patients who underwent surgery in the latter 5 years of the study had lower odds of recurrence (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.19, 0.93, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Rectal adenomas managed by transanal endoscopic surgery are lesions at high risk for recurrence; surveillance should be performed within the first 2 years and continued for a total of at least 5 years. Most recurrences can be successfully treated with repeat TEM or endoscopic resection.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 39733405\nTitle: Pathologic Features of Rectal Adenocarcinoma after Preoperative Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation Therapy and the Prognostic Factors for Local Recurrence: A Retrospective Study at Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital.\nAuthors: Boonplod C, Kongkarnka S, Supatrakul E\nJournal: Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP\nPublication Date: 2024 Dec 1\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is a significant global health concern, with Thailand reporting notable incidence rates. Locally advanced rectal cancer demands effective treatment strategies to reduce the risk of local recurrence post-surgery; however, the predictive factors for local recurrence are uncertain.. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated patients with rectal adenocarcinoma undergoing preoperative concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT). The pathological findings and predictors of local recurrence in rectal adenocarcinoma were examined following preoperative CCRT. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in patients with rectal adenocarcinoma who underwent preoperative CCRT and surgery at the Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital from January 2018 to December 2022. Data were collected from patients to investigate the associations between pathological prognostic factors and local recurrence of rectal adenocarcinoma. For the analysis of continuous variables, the Student's t-test was employed to assess univariate associations. In the case of categorical variables, comparisons were made using the chi-square test and the Kruskal-Wallis test. Furthermore, the Kaplan-Meier method, supplemented by the log-rank test, was utilized to examine the relationships between baseline prognostic variables and disease-free survival endpoints. RESULTS: Of the 70 patients who received preoperative CCRT, 14 (20%) experienced recurrence. Univariate log-rank analysis identified five pathologic predictors of the disease-free survival of preoperative CCRT patients: ypT stage (p = 0.0030), lymphatic space invasion (p = 0.0033), venous invasion (p = 0.0345), circumferential resection margin (CRM) (p = 0.0003), and TNM staging (p = 0.0109). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, ypTNM stage and CRM status were independent predictors for disease progression of preoperative CCRT patients. CONCLUSION: ypTNM staging and CRM status emerged as independent predictors of local recurrence. The study also identified age and gender variations in rectal cancer incidence, highlighting the importance of tailored screening approaches.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 23008301\nTitle: Randomized trial of short-course radiotherapy versus long-course chemoradiation comparing rates of local recurrence in patients with T3 rectal cancer: Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group trial 01.04.\nAuthors: Ngan SY, Burmeister B, Fisher RJ\nJournal: Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology\nPublication Date: 2012 Nov 1\nAbstract: PURPOSE: To compare the local recurrence (LR) rate between short-course (SC) and long-course (LC) neoadjuvant radiotherapy for rectal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had ultrasound- or magnetic resonance imaging-staged T3N0-2M0 rectal adenocarcinoma within 12 cm from anal verge. SC consisted of pelvic radiotherapy 5 x 5 Gy in 1 week, early surgery, and six courses of adjuvant chemotherapy. LC was 50.4 Gy, 1.8 Gy/fraction, in 5.5 weeks, with continuous infusional fluorouracil 225 mg/m(2) per day, surgery in 4 to 6 weeks, and four courses of chemotherapy. RESULTS: Three hundred twenty-six patients were randomly assigned; 163 patients to SC and 163 to LC. Median potential follow-up time was 5.9 years (range, 3.0 to 7.8 years). Three-year LR rates (cumulative incidence) were 7.5% for SC and 4.4% for LC (difference, 3.1%; 95% CI, -2.1 to 8.3; P = .24). For distal tumors (< 5 cm), six of 48 SC patients and one of 31 LC patients experienced local recurrence (P = .21). Five-year distant recurrence rates were 27% for SC and 30% for LC (log-rank P = 0.92; hazard ratio [HR] for LC:SC, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.56). Overall survival rates at 5 years were 74% for SC and 70% for LC (log-rank P = 0.62; HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.67). Late toxicity rates were not substantially different (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer G3-4: SC, 5.8%; LC, 8.2%; P = .53). CONCLUSION: Three-year LR rates between SC and LC were not statistically significantly different; the CI for the difference is consistent with either no clinically important difference or differences in favor of LC. LC may be more effective in reducing LR for distal tumors. No differences in rates of distant recurrence, relapse-free survival, overall survival, or late toxicity were detected.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

METHODS: One hundred and thirty-six extraperitoneal adenocarcinoma patients (33 low rectum T2, 74 T3, 29 T4 [without sacral invasion], 25 with mucinous subtype) were treated with posterior pelvis preoperative radiotherapy (5040 cGy total dose, 180 cGy/fr, 5 fr/w, 10-15 MV linac X-rays) and concomitant 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy. After 6 to 8 weeks patients underwent surgery and prechemoradiation clinical stage was compared with pathologic stage to evaluate downstaging in each patient. Seventy-four patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. Median follow-up was 39 months (4-84). RESULTS: Forty-four patients had macroscopic complete response, 52 patients had partial response, 37 patients showed no change and 3 patients had progression. At multivariate analysis only histotype showed correlation with downstaging (hazard ratio = 0.350 and 0.138 - 0.885 95 percent confidence interval) because of the evidence for poor downstaging in mucinous subtype. There were no significant differences in overall survival and progression-free survival between adenocarcinoma and mucinous subtype. CONCLUSIONS: The main finding is that mucinous histology is associated with poor downstaging after preoperative chemoradiation but this poor response was not associated with worse outcome in this small study. The good outcome for mucinous histology is at odds with other reports in the literature and requires further study.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 39656552\nTitle: Overexpression of ST8Sia1 inhibits tumor progression by TGF-beta1 signaling in rectal adenocarcinoma and promotes the tumoricidal effects of CD8(+) T cells by granzyme B and perforin.\nAuthors: Zhang C, Wang Y, Yu Y\nJournal: Annals of medicine\nPublication Date: 2025 Dec\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Rectal adenocarcinoma (READ) involves the dysregulated expression of alpha 2,8-Sialyltransferase1 (ST8Sia1) although its role during READ's progression is unclear. METHODS: The mRNA level of ST8Sia1 was analyzed based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) 2.0. Furthermore, the prognostic and significance of ST8Sia1 in READ was assessed through Kaplan-Meier curve, univariate, multivariate Cox regression, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) methods. The role of ST8Sia1 in the READ immune microenvironment was explored using ESTIMATE analysis and TIMER databases. Furthermore, the expression of ST8Sia1 in tissues was analyzed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), western blotting (WB), and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Perforin and Granzyme B secretion by CD8(+) T cells, as well as tumor cell apoptosis, were detected after co-culturing CD8(+) T cells with READ tumor cells and ST8Sia1-overexpression (ST8Sia1-OE) tumor cells. Furthermore, we examined the interaction between ST8Sia1 and TGF-beta1 in READ cells. RESULTS: ST8Sia1 exhibited excellent diagnostic capability for READ, with positive correlations to immune response and negative correlations to tumor purity. Increased levels of perforin and Granzyme B from CD8(+) T cells were observed in vitro, enhancing tumor cell apoptosis. ST8Sia1 interacts with TGF-beta1, mediating its inhibitory effects on READ development.

The patient has undergone various diagnostic tests and treatments, including chemotherapy with agents like oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and fluorouracil.\n\nThe PUBMED search results provide insights into the progression of rectal adenocarcinoma. According to Article #1, the pathological features of rectal adenocarcinoma after preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy, such as ypT Stage, lymphatic space invasion, venous invasion, circumferential resection margin, and TNM staging, are associated with local recurrence.\n\nArticle #2 highlights the association between mucinous rectal adenocarcinoma and tumor downstaging after preoperative chemoradiotherapy. The results suggest that mucinous histology is associated with poor downstaging after preoperative chemoradiation.\n\nArticle #3 discusses the role of ST8SIA1 in inhibiting tumor progression by TGF-BETA1 signaling in rectal adenocarcinoma and promoting the tumoricidal effects of CD8(+) T Cells by granzyme B and perforIN. The results suggest that ST8SIA1 is a potential diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for rectal adenocarcinoma, enhancing CD8(+) T cell function and possibly improving patient outcomes through cellular immunotherapy.\n\nConsidering the patient's medical history and the insights from the PUBMED search results, it is reasonable to assume that the patient's cancer is likely to progress in the next 24 months. However, the exact likelihood of progression would depend on various factors, including the stage of the cancer, the effectiveness of treatments, and the patient's overall health.\n\n[ANSWER: A]"

Survival is still depending on factors related to the patient, the tumor or the surgeon. AIM: The aim of our study is to report survival and prognosis factors of our patients managed for a rectal cancer. METHODS:   We report an descreptive retrospective study about 154 patients. SPSS 19.0 version was used for the statistical analysis. Desriptive study was done using means, and pourcentage. Survival was analysed using Kaplan meier curve. In univariate analysis, we calculated the odd ratio in order to evaluate risk factors. Multivariate analysis used Cox model. Significancy was 0.05. RESULTS: Global survival was 52.4% at 3 years and 42.4% at 5 years. Free reccurence survival was 76%  at 3 years and 69.15% at 5 years. In univariate analysis, factors significantly influencing survival were age>70 years, CAE level, tumor perforation, TNM, tumor differentiation, peroperative blood transfusion, and reccurency. In multivriate analysis, only age > 70 years, T and local reccurency were independants factors influencing survival. CONCLUSION:   A better knowledge of prognosis factors ead to a better management of this cancer with more adjuvant treatment indications and closer monitoring.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 37648878\nTitle: Survival outcomes of anal adenocarcinoma versus rectal adenocarcinoma: A retrospective cohort study.\nAuthors: Mankarious MM, Hughes AJ, Berg AS\nJournal: Indian journal of gastroenterology : official journal of the Indian Society of Gastroenterology\nPublication Date: 2023 Oct\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Anal adenocarcinoma (AA) is a rare malignancy with decreased survival compared to rectal adenocarcinoma (RA). However, AA continues to be treated with similar algorithms compared to rectal cancer with minimal data regarding the efficacy of these treatment algorithms. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients with non-metastatic AA at a single tertiary-care institution from 1995 to 2020. This cohort was matched 2:1 to a group of RA patients for comparison. The primary outcome of interest was overall survival rates. RESULTS: Sixteen patients with stages I-III AA were matched to a cohort of RA. There were no significant differences between the cohorts with regard to patient demographics, comorbidities, disease stage or histologic features. There were also no significant differences in treatment modalities between the two cohorts with a majority undergoing multimodal therapy with chemoradiation and surgery. All patients with AA demonstrated significantly worse survival than all patients with rectal adenocarcinoma (five-year survival 47.7% vs. 82.3%, respectively. p < 0.05). When looking at a sub-group of patients who underwent combination chemoradiation and surgery from each cohort, anal adenocarcinoma continued to exhibit lower overall survival (five-year survival 41.6% and 86.4%, respectively. p < 0.05). In a multi-variable model that adjusted for location, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)\ufeff stage and treatment pathway, tumor location in the anal canal was an independent predictor of overall survival (Hazard ratio [HR] 2.7, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: AA has worse survival as compared to RA despite similar treatment. This study highlights the need to evaluate the current classification and treatment pathways to improve outcomes.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 15383798\nTitle: Operative versus nonoperative treatment for stage 0 distal rectal cancer following chemoradiation therapy: long-term results.\nAuthors: Habr-Gama A, Perez RO, Nadalin W\nJournal: Annals of surgery\nPublication Date: 2004 Oct\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE: Report overall long-term results of stage 0 rectal cancer following neoadjuvant chemoradiation and compare long-term results between operative and nonoperative treatment. METHODS: Two-hundred sixty-five patients with distal rectal adenocarcinoma considered resectable were treated by neoadjuvant chemoradiation (CRT) with 5-FU, Leucovorin and 5040 cGy. Patients with incomplete clinical response were referred to radical surgical resection. Patients with incomplete clinical response treated by surgery resulting in stage p0 were compared to patients with complete clinical response treated by nonoperative treatment. Statistical analysis was performed using chi2, Student t test and Kaplan-Meier curves. RESULTS: Overall and disease-free 10-year survival rates were 97.7% and 84%. In 71 patients (26.8%) complete clinical response was observed following CRT (Observation group). Twenty-two patients (8.3%) showed incomplete clinical response and pT0N0M0 resected specimens (Resection group). There were no differences between patient's demographics and tumor's characteristics between groups. In the Resection group, 9 definitive colostomies and 7 diverting temporary ileostomies were performed. Mean follow-up was 57.3 months in Observation Group and 48 months in Resection Group. There were 3 systemic recurrences in each group and 2 endorectal recurrences in Observation Group. Two patients in the Resection group died of the disease. Five-year overall and disease-free survival rates were 88% and 83%, respectively, in Resection Group and 100% and 92% in Observation Group. CONCLUSIONS: Stage 0 rectal cancer disease is associated with excellent long-term results irrespective of treatment strategy. Surgical resection may not lead to improved outcome in this situation and may be associated with high rates of temporary or definitive stoma construction and unnecessary morbidity and mortality rates.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
