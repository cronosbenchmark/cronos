The CEA level has been elevated at 1.4000 ng/ml at age 62.560 and 1.3000 ng/ml at age 64.070.\n\nHowever, the patient has received chemo treatments, including Yttrium Y-90, Leucovorin, Oxaliplatin, and Fluorouracil, which may have slowed down the cancer progression.\n\nGiven the patient's age (64.1 years) and the recent PET scan results, it appears that the cancer has not progressed in the last 3 months. However, the cancer has spread to the liver, which indicates that it is still active and may continue to progress.\n\nGiven the available information, the most likely answer is:\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"
