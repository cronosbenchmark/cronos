        "content": "Based on the provided information, the patient's cancer has progressed at age 81.395, and the most recent scan at age 81.674 shows that the cancer has progressed. However, the patient has been receiving treatment, including targeted therapy with osimertinib, which was initiated at age 81.699 and is expected to continue until age 81.943.\n\nConsidering the patient's age and the fact that the cancer has progressed, I would say that the patient's survival in the next 12 months is uncertain. The patient's overall health and treatment history suggest that they have been receiving regular follow-up care and treatment, which may help manage their condition. However, the progression of the cancer at age 81.395 and the patient's age may indicate a poorer prognosis.\n\nGiven the complexity of the patient's condition and the fact that the cancer has progressed, I would say that the patient will likely NOT be alive in the next 12 months.\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"
