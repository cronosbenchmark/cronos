However, the patient has also had some periods of stable disease, including from ages 65.674 to 65.726.\n\nGiven the patient's history of cancer progression and recurrence, as well as the recent period of stable disease, I would say that the likelihood of the patient being alive in the next 12 months is:\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"
