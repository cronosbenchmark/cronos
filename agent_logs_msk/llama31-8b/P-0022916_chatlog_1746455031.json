The most recent information available is from the timeline3.txt file, which indicates that the patient's CEA levels have been fluctuating, but there is no indication of a significant increase in the past few months.\n\nThe patient's most recent CEA level was 1.5000 ng/ml at age 59.740, and the most recent CT scan revealed no evidence of cancer progression at age 59.428.\n\nConsidering the patient's age and the fact that the cancer has not progressed in the past few months, I would assess that the patient's prognosis is generally good. However, the patient's cancer is still considered a high-risk cancer, and ongoing monitoring and treatment will be necessary to ensure the best possible outcome.\n\nBased on this information, I would choose the option that indicates the patient will be still alive in the next 12 months.\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"
