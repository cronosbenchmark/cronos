Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

The optimum management algorithm is yet to be established. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic factors of survival and to determine the operative benefit of resection of the primary tumour followed by chemotherapy. METHODS: Seven hundred twenty-eight consecutive patients who presented with stage IV CRC from 1999 to 2007 were identified. The demographics and clinicopathological characteristics of these patients were reviewed. Survival curves were constructed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analysis assessed independent prognostic factors. RESULTS: In the surgical management of the primary, 79% (n = 572) were performed electively, 18% (n = 134) as an emergency procedure and 3% (n = 22) did not have any surgery. Twelve percent (n = 78) had a permanent stoma. Major morbidity was 4.3% (n = 31), and 30-day mortality was low at 6% (n = 46). Ten percent (n = 71) had a subsequent metasectomy. Patients who underwent curative resections tended to be female (p = 0.05), of a younger age group (age, </= 50; p = 0.005), as well as had better haemoglobin (p = 0.0001) and albumin levels (p = 0.0001). For the study cohort, the cancer-specific survival (CSS) at 1 year was 47.9% [95% confidence interval (CI), 44.2-51.6%], 3-year CSS was 10.8% (95% CI, 3.3-13.3%) and 5-year CSS was 7.0% (95% CI, 4.8-9.2%). CSS was significantly higher in patients that underwent colonic resection. In cases where resection of the primary was possible, multivariate analysis revealed that CEA value >40 ng/ml, low albumin levels </= 34 g/l, poorly differentiated tumours, advanced tumour stage (T3/T4), nodal disease (N1/N2) and presence of diffuse metastasis were all significant factors associated with poorer cancer-specific survival. CONCLUSION: This study has shown a good survival benefit in stage IV CRC when an aggressive policy of primary resection is adopted. Resection of metastases with curative intent should be performed whenever possible.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 32323439\nTitle: Impact of older age on clinicopathological and prognostic features of colon cancer in postmenopausal women.\nAuthors: Honma N, Matsuda Y, Arai T\nJournal: Pathology international\nPublication Date: 2020 Jul\nAbstract: To clarify the clinicopathological features of colorectal cancer in older people, systematic studies considering age, sex, and the tumor locus is needed. We focused on colon cancer in postmenopausal women (<70 years, n = 68 vs. >/=70 years, n = 85), and examined the effect of age on clinicopathological features. Rates of medullary carcinoma /mucinous carcinoma were higher and pathological stages at diagnosis were less advanced in patients >/=70 years compared with <70 years. Matching pathological stages, no significant difference in disease-free interval was observed according to age; however, disease-specific survival (DSS) was poorer in patients >/=70 years than <70 years, being significantly different in stage IV cases. Regarding post-metastasis/recurrence (met/rec) cases, chemotherapy and surgery for metastasis were less frequent in those aged >/=70 years than <70 years. Post-met/rec DSS was poorer in >/=70 years, those with microsatellite instability, and those without surgery for met/rec than in each counterpart; however, post-met/rec chemotherapy exhibited no effect. Multivariate analyses revealed that an older age and no surgery for metastasis were independent predictors of disease-specific death. These findings remained after excluding stage IV cases. Older age was a potent risk factor of rapid disease-specific death after met/rec.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 31464932\nTitle: Overall survival of colorectal cancer by stage at diagnosis: Data from the Martinique Cancer Registry.\nAuthors: Joachim C, Macni J, Drame M\nJournal: Medicine\nPublication Date: 2019 Aug\nAbstract: Population-based cancer registries (PBCR) participate in epidemiological surveillance and in the evaluation of cancer types by enabling analysis of incidence and survival data over time. The aim of this study was to examine overall survival (OS) in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) by analyzing data from the Martinique population-based cancer registry between 1993 and 2012. All colorectal cancer cases diagnosed in Martinique between 1993 and 2012 were included. Characteristics of CRC patients were analyzed according to age subgroups, namely: <50 years, 50 to 74 years and over 75 years.We recorded the following socio-demographic and clinical variables: year of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, sex, histology, zone of residence, and subsite of the cancer. Incidence of malignant neoplasms of the colon and rectum (ICD-10 C18-21) was extracted from the Martinique Cancer Registry database. Stage at diagnosis (localized: stage I-II, regional: stage III and metastatic stage: stage IV) were also analyzed for the 2008 to 2012 period.A total of 2230 cases of incident invasive CRC were included during the study period (1993-2012): 1171 were women (52.5%); 1588 patients (71.2%) had colon cancer. Stage at diagnosis was evaluated in 779 patients (89.6%): 486/779 (62.4%) had stage III-IV at diagnosis, including 285 (36.6%) patients with metastases at diagnosis (stage IV). One-year, 5-year and 10-year OS for the study period 1993 to 2012 was 74.6%, 43.8% and 33.0% respectively. There was a statistical difference in overall survival according to gender (P = .0153), age at diagnosis (P < .001) and stage (P < .001).Median OS was 2.0 years (95% CI [1.4-2.1]) in the stage III-IV group during the period 2008 to 2012, whereas it was unreached in the stage I-II group. Multivariable analysis confirmed that stage III-IV at diagnosis (hazard ratio (HR) = 3.70 [2.89-4.99]; P < .0001) and colon cancer (HR = 1.30 [1.01-1.69]; P = .04) were main prognostic factors for OS. Women had a HR of 0.78 [0.62-0.96], P = .02. CRC patients in the 50 to 74 years age group had a HR of 0.63 [0.50-0.80], P = .0001.This study underlines the importance of structuring management of CRC cancer patients.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: timeline1.txt] included in your
