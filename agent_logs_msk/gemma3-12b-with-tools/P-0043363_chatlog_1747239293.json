However, treatment outcomes of these patients vary. This study was conducted to evaluate the impact of specific metastatic sites on treatment outcomes of patients with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma with susceptible EGFR mutations receiving first-line gefitinib, focusing on the impact of liver metastasis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between October 2009 and April 2014, patients of stage IV lung adenocarcinoma harboring EGFR mutation in exon 19 or 21, who received first-line gefitinib treatment, were enrolled in two hospitals and followed until December 22, 2014. The impacts of various clinical features, including sex, age, smoking history, performance status, EGFR mutation site, metastatic sites, etc., on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 148 patients were eligible for analysis. Patients with liver metastasis on initial diagnosis (n=19) had shorter PFS and OS than those without liver metastasis did (median of PFS, 6.7 vs. 11.2 months, p<0.0001; median of OS, 9.2 vs. 17.5 months, p<0.0001). Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed liver metastasis was an independent poor prognostic factor for PFS (HR=2.939 [95% CI: 1.729-4.997], p<0.0001) and OS (HR=3.300 [95% CI: 1.708-6.373], p=0.0004). CONCLUSION: Liver metastasis predicts poorer PFS and OS in stage IV lung adenocarcinoma patients with susceptible gene mutations receiving first-line gefitinib. Further study is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and find treatment modalities to improve prognosis of these patients.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 27449299\nTitle: Prognostic effect of liver metastasis in lung cancer patients with distant metastasis.\nAuthors: Ren Y, Dai C, Zheng H\nJournal: Oncotarget\nPublication Date: 2016 Aug 16\nAbstract: Because the need of clinical prognostic evaluation by specific metastatic organ, we aim to analyze the prognostic factors in lung cancer patients with M1b disease with Surveillance Epidemiology and End-Results database (SEER). This retrospective study evaluated lung cancer patients of adenocarcinoma (AD), squamous cell carcinoma (SQCC), and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) selected from SEER. We provided the prognostic correlates of overall survival (OS) and lung cancer-specific survival (LCSS) in this population. 23,679 eligible patients were included. Bone was the most common metastatic site in AD (63.1%) and SQCC (61.1%), while liver was the most prevalent site (61.9%) in SCLC. Single site metastasis was significantly associated with better outcome compared to multiple sites metastases in all patients. Among patients with single site metastasis, OS and LCSS were longer for AD and SCLC if involving brain or bone, with median survival time of 5 to 7 months, comparing to 3 months if invloving liver (all p-values < 0.001). Similarly, among patients with multiple metastases, better outcomes were observed in AD patients (4 vs 3 months; OS and LCSS, p < 0.001) and SCLC patients (6 vs 4 months; OS, p = 0.017; LCSS, p = 0.023) without liver metastasis compared to those with liver metastasis. In conclusion, we estimated multiple survival outcomes by histology of primary tumor and sites of metastasis. Liver metastasis is found to be the worst prognostic factor for AD and SCLC patients with distant metastasis. More in-depth research is warranted to identify patients who are prone to develop distance metastasis, especially to liver.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 27286454\nTitle: Heterogeneity of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma: Lung metastasis show better prognosis than liver metastasis-a case control study.\nAuthors: Decoster C, Gilabert M, Autret A\nJournal: Oncotarget\nPublication Date: 2016 Jul 19\nAbstract: The prognosis of metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is grim, with a median overall survival of under 1 year. In our clinical practice, we observed a few cases of isolated lung metastases from PDAC with unusually long outcomes. We compared these cases in a case-control study of lung-only vs. liver-only metastases from PDAC.From our database, we found 37 cases of lung-only metastases and paired them with 37 cases of liver-only metastases by age, tumor location and treatment.The lung-only group differed significantly from the liver-only group with respect to the following parameters: female predominance, more metachronous cases, fewer nodules per patient, and smaller increases in tumor markers. Local invasion parameters (i.e., arterial or venous involvement) were not significantly different. The outcomes were significantly different, with a median overall survival from the occurrence of metastases of 20.8 vs. 9.1 months and a median progression-free survival of 11 vs. 3.5 months.In conclusion, this case-control study seemed to confirm that lung-only PDAC metastases have prognoses different from those of liver-only metastases. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying these differences will help identify abnormalities associated with tumor aggressiveness.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Patients with unresectable HAL have a shorter survival time ranges from 1 to 36 months. Here, we reported a 65-year-old female patient with unresectable alpha-fetoprotein-producing HAL harboring KRAS-G12V and no other targetable driver mutations. The patient was treated with multiple lines of chemotherapies followed by PD-1 inhibitor, sintilimab, due to positive staining of PD-L1, and achieved an overall survival of 52 months. Although the disease was under control, the patient experienced fifth-grade pneumonia and died after 6 months of anti-PD-1 treatment. This is the first case of KRAS-positive HAL patient achieved stable disease by PD-1 inhibitor, which may provide valuable information for the treatment strategy development of advanced HAL patients, and highlights the importance of molecular diagnosis in treatment decision-making.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 31178388\nTitle: PD-L1 Expression of Lung Cancer Cells, Unlike Infiltrating Immune Cells, Is Stable and Unaffected by Therapy During Brain Metastasis.\nAuthors: Teglasi V, Pipek O, Lozsa R\nJournal: Clinical lung cancer\nPublication Date: 2019 Sep\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Approximately 50% of brain metastases originate from non-small-cell lung cancer. The median survival of patients with brain metastases is 1 month without treatment. Novel immunotherapeutic strategies, such as those targeting the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)/programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) axis, are promising in patients with advanced systemic disease but are often preferentially administered to patients with tumors showing PD-L1 positivity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Surgically resected paired primary lung adenocarcinoma and brain metastasis samples of 61 patients were analyzed. We compared the paired samples regarding the amount of peritumoral and stromal mononuclear infiltration, PD-L1 expression of tumor and immune cells, and PD-1 expression of immune cells. We investigated the effect of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and steroid therapy on PD-L1 expression in brain metastases. RESULTS: There was significant positive correlation regarding the PD-L1 expression of tumor cells between the paired primary lung adenocarcinoma and brain metastatic samples with the use of different cutoff levels (1%, 5%, 50%). We found no impact of chemotherapy or steroid therapy on the changes of PD-L1 expression of tumor cells between the 2 sites. There is no or only limited concordance of the proportion of PD-1- or PD-L1-positive tumor-associated immune cells between the paired tumor samples, which suggests that brain metastases develop their own immune environment. CONCLUSION: We observed a strong correlation of PD-L1 positive tumor cells between primary lung adenocarcinoma cases and their corresponding brain metastases, which is not significantly influenced by chemotherapy or steroid therapy.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 30771085\nTitle: Efficacy of nintedanib and docetaxel in patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma treated with first-line chemotherapy and second-line immunotherapy in the nintedanib NPU program.\nAuthors: Corral J, Majem M, Rodriguez-Abreu D\nJournal: Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico\nPublication Date: 2019 Sep\nAbstract: PURPOSE: Both nintedanib/docetaxel and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapies have demonstrated efficacy as second-line treatment of patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma. This is the first report on the efficacy of the nintedanib/docetaxel combination following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy and subsequent immunotherapy in a real-world setting. METHODS/PATIENTS: From May 2014 to December 2015, 390 patients in 108 Spanish centres enrolled in the nintedanib named patient use program. Inclusion criteria were advanced lung adenocarcinoma with progressive disease following at least one line of platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. The objective was to evaluate the efficacy of the nintedanib/docetaxel combination in patients who also received immunotherapy. RESULTS: Eleven patients met the inclusion criteria; with a median age of 67 years. PD-L1 expression was positive in six patients. Median progression-free survival (PFS) of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy was 3.3 months (95% CI 1.9-4.6). Second-line immunotherapy was pembrolizumab (36.5%), atezolizumab (36.5%) or nivolumab (27%). Median PFS of second-line immunotherapy was 2.3 months (95% CI 0-6.1). The overall response rate (ORR) to second-line immunotherapy was 18% with a disease-control rate (DCR) of 45%. Median PFS of nintedanib/docetaxel was 3.2 months (95% CI 1.9-4.5). Best response was partial response in four patients (36%), stable disease in five patients (46%), and progressive disease in two patients (18%), for an ORR of 36% and a DCR of 82%. CONCLUSION: Our experience suggests an encouraging efficacy of nintedanib/docetaxel in patients with adenocarcinoma NSCLC pretreated with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy and immunotherapy, reinforcing the importance of an optimal therapeutic sequence for managing advanced lung adenocarcinoma.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Here's my assessment, incorporating the new information:\n\nThe articles provide some helpful context, though none directly address the specific scenario of a patient with stable disease and PD-L1 positivity.\n\n*   **Article 1 (HAL case report):** While focused on a rare subtype (HAL), it highlights the potential for prolonged survival (52 months) with PD-1 inhibitors even after multiple lines of chemotherapy. This suggests that immunotherapy can be effective in controlling the disease, even in advanced cases.\n*   **Article 2 (Brain Metastases):** This article reinforces the stability of PD-L1 expression in lung adenocarcinoma, even in the setting of brain metastases and treatment. This suggests that PD-L1 positivity is a relatively consistent biomarker.\n*   **Article 3 (Nintedanib/Docetaxel):** This article demonstrates that even after failure of both chemotherapy and immunotherapy, nintedanib/docetaxel can still provide benefit (PFS of 3.2 months, DCR of 82%).\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nGiven the patient's age (63), the fact that she has already received chemotherapy, and the current stable disease state, predicting survival is challenging. However, the lack of progression for the past year is a very positive sign. The PD-L1 positivity suggests potential responsiveness to immunotherapy if it were to be considered. The patient's ECOG performance status of 1 indicates a relatively good functional status.\n\nConsidering all factors, and the potential for ongoing management and interventions, I believe the patient has a reasonable chance of survival for the next 12 months. While lung cancer is a serious disease, the current stability and the potential for future therapies support a cautiously optimistic outlook.\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"
