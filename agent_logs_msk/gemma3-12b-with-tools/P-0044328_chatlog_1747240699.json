Methods: The clinical data of 290 patients with pathologically diagnosed stage \u2162A-N2 NSCLC after curative resection and adjuvant chemotherapy from January 2010 to December 2014 at our department were retrospectively analyzed. The survival and recurrence patterns were observed, and the factors affecting locoregional recurrence were analyzed. Results: The median survival time was 31.5 months. The 1-, 3-and 5-year survival rates were 88.3%, 46.0% and 33.2%, respectively. The median locoregional control time was 38.5 months. The 1-, 3-and 5-year locoregional control rates were 78.6%, 55.2% and 41.0%, respectively. The median distant metastasis-free survival was 26.8 months. The 1-, 3-and 5-year distant metastasis-free survival rates were 76.4%, 45.5% and 39.5%, respectively. The median progression-free survival was 19.1 months. The 1-, 3-and 5-year progression-free survival rates were 64.1%, 32.5% and 23.8%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that clinical N status, histological type, pathological T stage, operation mode, the number of positive N2 lymph nodes and the number of positive N2 lymph node stations had a significant influence on overall survival; clinical N status, histological type, the number of positive N2 lymph nodes and the number of positive N2 lymph node stations had a significant influence on locoregional control. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the number of N2 positive lymph nodes (P= 0.017) was an independent factor for overall survival of stage \u2162A-N2 patients; the number of N2 positive lymph nodes (P=0.009) and histological type (P=0.005) were independent factors for locoregional recurrence. For left-sided lung cancer, the lymph node station failure sites were mostly in 2R, 4R, 5, 6 and 7, and the contralateral mediastinum was frequently involved. For right-sided lung cancer, the lymph node station failure sites were mostly in 2R, 4R, 7, 10R and surgical stump. Conclusions: Clinical N2, squamous cell carcinoma, positive N2 nodes of more than 3 and multiple positive N2 stations are poor prognostic factors for locoregional recurrence. Locoregional recurrence of left lung cancer frequently involves the contralateral mediastinum, while that of the right lung cancer usually locates in the ipsilateral mediastinum.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 23263700\nTitle: Predictors for locoregional recurrence for clinical stage III-N2 non-small cell lung cancer with nodal downstaging after induction chemotherapy and surgery.\nAuthors: Amini A, Lou F, Correa AM\nJournal: Annals of surgical oncology\nPublication Date: 2013 Jun\nAbstract: PURPOSE: Pathologic downstaging following chemotherapy for stage III-N2 NSCLC is a well-known positive prognostic indicator. However, the predictive factors for locoregional recurrence (LRR) in these patients are largely unknown. METHODS: Between 1998 and 2008, 153 patients with clinically or pathologically staged III-N2 NSCLC from two cancer centers in the United States were treated with induction chemotherapy and surgery. All had pathologic N0-1 disease, and none received postoperative radiotherapy. LRR were defined as recurrence at the surgical site, lymph nodes (levels 1-14 including supraclavicular), or both. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 39.3 months. Pretreatment N2 status was confirmed pathologically (18.2 %) or by PET/CT (81.8 %). Overall, the 5-year LRR rate was 30.8 % (n = 38), with LRR being the first site of failure in 51 % (22/+99877943). Five-year overall survival for patients with LRR compared with those without was 21 versus 60.1 % (p < 0.001). Using multivariate analysis, significant predictors for LRR were pN1 disease at time of surgery (p < 0.001, HR 3.43, 95 % CI 1.80-6.56) and a trend for squamous histology (p = 0.072, HR 1.93, 95 % CI 0.94-3.98). Five-year LRR rate for pN1 versus pN0 disease was 62 versus 20 %. Neither single versus multistation N2 disease (p = 0.291) nor initial staging technique (p = 0.306) were predictors for LRR. N1 status also was predictive for higher distant recurrence (p = 0.021, HR 1.91, 95 % CI 1.1-3.3) but only trended for poorer survival (p = 0.123, HR 1.48, 95 % CI 0.9-2.44). CONCLUSIONS: LRR remains high in resected stage III-N2 NSCLC patients after induction chemotherapy and nodal downstaging, particularly in patients with persistent N1 disease.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 29058973\nTitle: Post-recurrence survival analysis of stage I non-small-cell lung cancer.\nAuthors: Lee K, Kim HR, Kim DK\nJournal: Asian cardiovascular & thoracic annals\nPublication Date: 2017 Nov\nAbstract: Background The aim of this retrospective study was to review recurrence patterns of stage I non-small-cell lung cancer and identify prognostic factors for post-recurrence survival. Methods Among 940 patients with pathological stage I non-small-cell lung cancer who underwent curative resection, 261 experienced a recurrence; of these, 188 had adenocarcinoma and 62 had squamous cell carcinoma. Oligo-recurrence was defined as 1-3 recurrent lesions restricted to a single organ. Potentially curative local treatment included surgery, stereotactic radiotherapy, and photodynamic therapy. Results The median follow-up duration was 65 months (range 4-186 months). The most common site of recurrence was the lung in 145 patients, followed by mediastinal lymph nodes in 49, pleura in 30, and brain in 27. Local treatment for recurrent tumors included surgery in 59 patients, stereotactic radiotherapy in 46, photodynamic therapy in 2, and other radiotherapy in 41. Seventy-eight patients received chemotherapy only, and 35 received conservative treatment. Among 125 patients who were evaluated for an epidermal growth factor receptor gene mutation, 31 were treated with epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The 3- and 5-year post-recurrence survival rates were 49.1% and 33.8%, respectively. Age at recurrence, adenocarcinoma cell type, disease-free interval, epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment, and potentially curative local treatment were independent prognostic factors for survival in multivariate analysis. Conclusions Local treatment for recurrence should be considered in selected candidates, and use of epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor I is reasonable if an epidermal growth factor receptor mutation is detected.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

METHODS: Retrospective review was conducted on 79 chemotherapy-naive cases of advanced NSCLC treated with GEM and DDP from October 1999 to November 2005.Among 79 patients,51 were male and 28 female;the median age was 53 years old(ranged from 21 to 74);there were 17 cases of squamous cell carcinoma,53 cases of adenocarcinoma,3 cases of large cell carcinoma,1 case of adeno-sqamous cell carcinoma,5 unidentified cases;there were 26 cases in IIIB stage and 53 cases in IV stage according to AJCC 1997 standard.All patients received GEM 800-1250 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8 and DDP 75-80 mg/m(2) on day 1 or 30 mg/m(2) for three days by intravenous administration,with 21 days as one cycle.Each patient received 2-4 cycles chemotherapy. RESULTS: The total clinical reponse rate(complete and partial response) was 31.6%,and clinical benefit rate(complete and partial response and stable disease) was 73.4%.1-year survival rate was 64.9%,2-year survival rate was 32%.After median follow-up of 2.33 years,median TTP was 5.06 months.The main toxicities were nausea,vomitting and hematological toxicities.The rates of grade III to IV leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were 25.4% and 31.6% respectively.Other toxicities were slight and tolerable. CONCLUSIONS: Combined chemotherapy with GEM plus DDP as first-line treatment to advanced NSCLC is an effective and feasible regimen,which is one of the standard regimens.For old patients,this regimen is a good choice.The fit dosage of GEM for Chinese is 1000 mg/m(2).\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 11956647\nTitle: Dose-intense phase II study of weekly cisplatin and epidoxorubicin plus medroxyprogesterone acetate and recombinant interleukin 2 in stage IIIB-IV non-small cell lung cancer.\nAuthors: Mantovani G, Maccio A, Mulas C\nJournal: Oncology reports\nPublication Date: 2002 May-Jun\nAbstract: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness in terms of response rates, toxicity and survival of the combination chemotherapy regimen cisplatin and epidoxorubicin (epirubicin) including medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), recombinant IL-2 (rIL-2) and antioxidants in patients with advanced (stage IIIB-IV) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Thirty-three chemotherapy-naive patients with NSCLC were enrolled in the study and 30 of them were evaluable. The mean age of the patients was 61 years. Twenty (66.7%) out of 30 patients were >or=60 years, and 5 (16.7%) patients were >or=70 years. The ECOG performance status was 0 to 1 in 30 patients and 2 in 3 patients. Twenty-six patients (78.8%) had stage IIIB disease and 7 (21.2%) had stage IV; histology was mainly squamous cell carcinoma (72.7%). The treatment consisted of cisplatin 40 mg/m2/week and epirubicin 40 mg/m2/week both intravenously on day 1, rIL-2 1.8 MIU/day subcutaneously, MPA 1 g/day orally, alpha-lipoic acid 300 mg/day orally and N-acetyl cysteine 1.8 g/day orally. The treatment was administered for 6 weeks. Patients with a complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) continued the treatment, according to response re-evaluation, until 15 weeks. The present study reports the results of 6, 9, 12 and 15-week treatment. After 6 weeks, 30 patients were assessable for response: no CR was observed, a PR was achieved in 15 patients (50%; ORR 50%). After 15 weeks, 1 CR and 8 PR were observed (ORR 30.0%). The median follow-up period was 13 months. The median duration of response was 9 months. The median overall survival (OS) was 15 months. The one-year survival rate was 55.8%. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 10 months. The toxicity was, as expected, mainly hematologic: neutropenia was the most significant symptom. The non-hematologic toxicity was quite low. Therefore, the treatment's toxicity was quite acceptable. There was no toxic death. The 30.0% ORR, the 15 month OS and the 10 month PFS obtained in this study are comparable with those observed with cisplatin plus epirubicin (ORR 39-54%) in phase II studies and in a previous phase III study (ORR 33%, OS 10.5 months). Moreover, the toxicity was acceptable and it was mainly hematologic. Serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines significantly decreased after treatment.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 31903241\nTitle: A phase II study of concurrent nab-paclitaxel/carboplatin combined with thoracic radiotherapy in locally advanced squamous cell lung cancer.\nAuthors: Wu K, Zhu L, Wang J\nJournal: Journal of thoracic disease\nPublication Date: 2019 Nov\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: The development of chemoradiotherapy is urgently needed for locally advanced squamous cell lung cancer due to its poor prognosis and significant toxicity. Carboplatin combined with nab-paclitaxel is a useful choice as first-line therapy in advanced squamous cell lung cancer. This prospective phase II study aimed to explore the efficacy and toxicity of concurrent chemoradiotherapy with nab-paclitaxel, carboplatin, and thoracic radiotherapy in unresectable locally advanced squamous cell lung cancer. METHODS: Patients with unresectable stage III squamous cell lung cancer were eligible. All patients received nab-paclitaxel weekly at a dose of 60 mg/m(2), in combination with carboplatin [area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) 2] weekly during concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Thoracic radiation was administered at a dose of 66 Gy/33 fractions. The consolidation chemotherapy consisted of nab-paclitaxel (260 mg/m(2) on day 1) and carboplatin (AUC 6 on day 1) every 21 days was administered in two cycles after the concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. RESULTS: Initially, enrollment of 21 patients was planned; however, the trial was prematurely closed due to slow recruitment. Finally, a total of 8 patients were enrolled between January 2012 and July 2015 from one institute. All patients completed concurrent chemoradiotherapy, and 6 patients (75.0%) received consolidation chemoradiotherapy. The ORR was 75%, with complete response (CR) 1 (12.5%), partial remission 6 (62.5%), stable disease 1 (12.5%), progressive disease 1 (12.5%), respectively. After a median follow-up of 15.2 (range, 2.3-51.5) months, 7 patients were dead, and 1 was alive. The median PFS and OS were 12.1 and 15.2 months, respectively. According to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0, 6 patients (75.0%) experienced acute radiation esophagitis, 4 (50.0%) were grade 2 (G2), and 2 (25.0%) were G3; 4 patients (50%) experienced acute radiation pneumonitis, 3 (37.5%) were G2, and 1 (12.5%) was G3. No late radiation-induced esophageal and pulmonary toxicity was observed after 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent nab-paclitaxel, carboplatin, and thoracic radiotherapy was shown to be an effective regimen for patients with unresectable locally advanced squamous cell lung cancer; however, further study should exercise caution due to the severe radiation esophagitis.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.
