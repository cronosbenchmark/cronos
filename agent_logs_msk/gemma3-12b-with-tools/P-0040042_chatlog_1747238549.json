platinum-based chemotherapy drug in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nCapecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers. Capecitabine is a prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to fluorouracil (antimetabolite) in the tumor, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor tissue.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n"

Detailed histology: Adenoca In Tubulovillous Adenoma. Clinical Group: 3B. MSI status: MSS (Microsatellite Stable).\n*   **Initial Treatment:** Combination chemotherapy (Oxaliplatin, Fluorouracil, Leucovorin) from approximately 60.476 to 60.764. Radiation therapy was also administered.\n*   **Subsequent Treatment:** Chemo (Capecitabine) from approximately 60.783 to 61.0544.\n*   **CEA Levels:** Fluctuated, initially elevated (10.3 ng/mL), then increased further (12.0 ng/mL, 12.3 ng/mL) during initial chemo, decreased to 4.6 ng/mL at 61.054, then increased to 5.0 ng/ml at 61.435.\n*   **Imaging (MR/CT):** Multiple MR and CT scans show \"cancer has NOT progressed\" at various time points (60.432, 60.770, 61.065, 61.191, 61.230, 61.345, 61.441). Lymph node involvement was noted on imaging.\n*   **Performance Status:** Initially ECOG 0, then ECOG 1 at 61.454.\n\nGiven the patient's history of rectal adenocarcinoma, the initial treatment regimen, and the fluctuating CEA levels despite imaging showing no progression, there is a possibility of recurrence. However, the consistent reports of \"no progression\" on imaging are reassuring.

This was treated with Paclitaxel and Carboplatin.\n*   **Recurrence & Progression:** The rectal cancer has recurred and progressed multiple times. Initially, progression was noted at 61.915. Later, progression was noted again at 62.720 and 64.159.\n*   **CEA Levels:** CEA levels have fluctuated, generally trending upwards, with a significant increase at 64.159 (8.0 ng/mL).\n*   **Imaging:** Imaging has shown progression of both cancers at various points.\n*   **Performance Status:** Performance status has fluctuated between ECOG 0 and 1.\n\n**Molecular Analysis:**\n\nThe specimen data provides the IMPACT468 gene panel results, but the specific mutations are not listed. This information would be crucial for a more precise prognosis.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\nGiven the patient's age (64.2), the presence of *both* recurrent and progressing rectal cancer *and* a new diagnosis of lung cancer, the prognosis is very poor. The multiple instances of progression, the rising CEA levels, and the development of a second malignancy all point towards a rapidly deteriorating clinical picture. While the patient has received multiple treatments, they have not been effective in controlling the disease.\n\nConsidering all of these factors, it is highly likely that the patient will not be alive in the next 12 months.\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"

It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nIrinotecan: Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used for chemotherapy. It is a water-soluble analogue of [camptothecin], which is extracted from the Chinese tree _Camptotheca acuminate_.[A263376] The bis-piperidine side chain in the structure of irinotecan bestows enhanced water solubility.[A263381] As an anticancer drug, irinotecan was first commercially available in Japan in 1994 to treat various cancers such as lung, cervical and ovarian cancer.[A263376] Approved by the FDA in 1996,[A263366] irinotecan is used to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[L50181, L50186, L50201] Irinotecan liposome was approved by the FDA in February 2024.[L50186]\r\n\r\nThe active metabolite SN-38 is also a potent inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. Both irinotecan and SN-38 mediate antitumor activity by forming a complex with topoisomerase\u2005I and blocking its enzymatic activity, thereby interfering with DNA synthesis.

Here's a summary of the key findings during the 64.2-65.2 year period and my assessment of the patient's prognosis:\n\n**Key Findings (64.2-65.2 years):**\n\n*   **Continued Progression:** Despite treatment with radiation and capecitabine, the rectal cancer continued to progress, with spread to reproductive organs and lymph nodes.\n*   **Lung Cancer Progression:** The lung adenocarcinoma also progressed, with spread to the pleura.\n*   **Treatment Changes:** The patient received Fluorouracil and Irinotecan.\n*   **CEA Levels:** Fluctuated, initially increasing to 10.9 ng/mL, then decreasing to 4.7 ng/mL, and then increasing again to 4.3 ng/mL.\n*   **Performance Status:** Fluctuated between ECOG 0 and 1.\n*   **Recent Imaging:** A recent MR scan (65.189) showed no progression, but involved the pleura.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe patient's condition has continued to deteriorate significantly. The cancers have both progressed, demonstrating resistance to multiple treatment regimens. The spread of the lung cancer to the pleura is particularly concerning. While the most recent MR scan showed no progression, the involvement of the pleura suggests a worsening of the lung cancer. The fluctuating CEA levels and performance status further indicate a challenging clinical picture.\n\nGiven the aggressive nature of the disease, the multiple sites of metastasis, the lack of durable response to treatment, and the patient's age (65.2), the prognosis is extremely poor. It is highly likely that the patient will not be alive in the next 12 months.\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"

VEGF-A.[A192888,A192939] Bevacizumab is generally indicated for use in combination with different chemotherapy regimens which are specific to the type, severity, and stage of cancer.[L12648] Bevacizumab was approved by Health Canada on March 24, 2010 and by the European Commission on April 21, 2021.[L45793,L43130] There are several biosimilars of bevacizumab, such as bevacizumab-awwb, bevacizumab-maly, bevacizumab-adcd, and bevacizumab-tnjn. \r\n\r\nInterestingly, researchers have identified higher VEGF expression in patients with COVID-19, which may contribute to lung pathologies
