Initially (age 68.052), the cancer had progressed. However, subsequent scans at ages 68.707 and 69.310 showed that the cancer had *not* progressed.\n*   **Current Age:** The patient is currently 69.5 years old.\n*   **MSI Status:** The tumor is microsatellite stable (MSS).\n*   **TMB:** The tumor has a TMB of 0.864698095.\n\nGiven the recent scans showing no progression and the patient's current age (69.5), it appears the treatment was initially effective in controlling the cancer.
