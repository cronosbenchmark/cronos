This study aimed to evaluate the value of ACT for patients with pT2N0M0 NSCLCs, and to identify the subgroups who could benefit from ACT. METHODS: Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate independent prognostic factors. High-risk factor (HRF) included visceral pleural invasion (VPI), lymphovascular invasion (LVI) and poor differentiation/undifferentiated tumors. RESULTS: Of the 899 patients, 277 (30.8%) patients received ACT. More younger patients (p < 0.001) and male patients (p = 0.007) received ACT. With the increase of pathological tumor size (p < 0.001) and the number of HRFs (p < 0.001), there was a significant rise in the proportion of patients receiving ACT. For all patients, ACT could not improve recurrence-free survival (RFS) (p = 0.672) and overall survival (OS) (p = 0.306). For patients with pathological stage IIA or radiological pure-solid tumors, ACT could significantly improve the OS (p = 0.011 and p = 0.037, respectively), and multivariate analysis revealed that ACT was an independent prognostic factor for patients with pathological stage IIA (p = 0.005). ACT could improve the OS significantly in patients with pathological stage IB pure-solid lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) (p = 0.043). CONCLUSION: ACT was valuable for patients with pathological stage IIA (pT2bN0M0) and patients with radiological pure-solid LUAD of pathological stage IB. A combination of radiological features and pathological subtypes could be helpful when selecting patients with pT2N0M0 NSCLCs for ACT.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 35402251\nTitle: Ground Glass Opacity and Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Pathological Stage IB-IIA Lung Adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Zhai W, Gong L, Zheng Y\nJournal: Frontiers in oncology\nPublication Date: 2022\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: The prognostic value of ground glass opacity (GGO) in stage IA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been widely recognized. However, studies investigating its value in the related stage IB-IIA lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains lacking. The impact of adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) on pathological stage IB-IIA LUAD is also controversial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of 501 patients with pathological stage IB-IIA LUAD at the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center from January 2008 to June 2018. We calculated and compared survival curves using the Kaplan-Meier test and log-rank test. Cox regression models were performed to determine independent prognostic factors of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). We established nomograms to predict the OS and DFS of LUAD patients. Calibration and receiver operator characteristic curves were conducted to assess the predictive performance of two nomograms. Based on the nomogram, we identified candidate patients that may most benefit from ACT after surgery. RESULTS: The number of patients with pure solid, part GGO, and pure GGO nodules was 240, 242, and 19, respectively, and 125 patients who received ACT. Patients with consolidation-to-tumor ratio (CTR) <0.75 had longer OS (P = 0.026) and DFS (P = 0.003). Pathological tumor size and at least 10 lymph nodes (LNs) resection were independent prognostic factors of both OS and DFS. CTR <0.75 was positively associated with DFS. The C-index of nomograms predicting individual OS and DFS was 0.660 and 0.634, respectively. Based on the nomogram for OS, ACT was found to be a positive prognostic indicator of OS (P = 0.031, HR = 0.5141, 95% CI 0.281-0.942) in patients with nomogram total points >/=5. CONCLUSION: CTR <0.75 is associated with a better DFS in patients with stage IB-IIA LUAD. Nomograms developed by integrating pathological tumor size, at least 10 LNs resection, and CTR >/=0.75 for predicting individual OS and DFS displayed a good predictive capacity and clinical value, which were also proved to be a useful tool for selecting patients most benefiting from ACT.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 31933987\nTitle: A combination of tumor and molecular markers predicts a poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma.\nAuthors: Liu C, Huang Q, Ma W\nJournal: International journal of clinical and experimental pathology\nPublication Date: 2019\nAbstract: PURPOSE: Whether patients with stage IA-IIA lung adenocarcinoma require conventional chemotherapy is still a controversy. An ideal metastasis risk prediction model in lung adenocarcinoma is valuable for determining the prognosis and giving timely, individualized treatment. RESULTS: Analyzing the clinical cases of 153 lung adenocarcinoma patients using an chi(2) test, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and a multivariate logistic regression analysis, we selected the most valuable factors for determining metastasis and constructed metastasis prediction models. We confirmed the importance of the tumor markers (CEA, NSE) and a molecular marker (CAMKII) as independent prognostic factors in lung adenocarcinoma. The result of a five-year survival status was significantly associated with CAMKII and CEA (P < 0.05). A nomogram was created using CEA, NSE, CYFRA 21-1, and CAMKII to estimate the metastasis probability for individuals, specifically, 78 stage I lung adenocarcinoma patients were used to verify the effectiveness of the nomogram. Using machine learning, LASSO selected the subset of variables that minimized the predictive error of the outcome, including CEA, NSE, CYFRA 21-1, CAMKII, tumor size, histologic type, lymph node status, smoking, and age. A ten-fold cross-validation showed the average accuracy of this model was 86.208%, with an area under the curve of 0.857, a sensitivity value of 0.840, and a specificity value of 0.873. CONCLUSION: Using both complementary methods, the predictive models illustrated that the combination of tumor markers and a key molecule to predict the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma patients in early stages is valuable. The postoperative transfer rate of stage I patients can be effectively predicted by these complementary methods.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Here's a synthesis of the information and my assessment of the patient's likelihood of survival over the next 24 months:\n\n*   **Article 1 (Thoracic Cancer, 2024):** This study suggests that adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) *can* improve overall survival (OS) for patients with pathological stage IIA lung adenocarcinoma.

Here's a summary of the key findings and my assessment of the patient's prognosis:\n\n*   **Recurrence:** The patient experienced a recurrence between ages 56.599 and 56.616, with evidence of disease in the lymph nodes and \"other\" sites (unspecified).\n*   **Treatment Response (Initial & Recurrence):** The patient initially received chemotherapy (Cisplatin and Pemetrexed) and had no progression detected. Following recurrence, the timeline shows chemotherapy again (Cisplatin and Pemetrexed) between ages 58.364 and 58.5365. However, there is a report of progression at age 58.517, followed by no progression at age 59.024 and then progression again at age 59.780.\n*   **Genetic Sequencing (specimen.txt):** The genetic sequencing data (IMPACT410 panel) is available, but I don't have the specific mutations identified. This information would be crucial for targeted therapy decisions.\n*   **Overall Trend:** The patient's cancer has demonstrated a pattern of recurrence and periods of stability, but ultimately shows progression.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\nThe recurrence and subsequent progression, despite chemotherapy, significantly worsen the prognosis. The fact that the cancer has recurred and is progressing suggests that the initial treatment was not fully effective and that the disease may be more aggressive. Without knowing the specific genetic mutations, it's difficult to predict the response to further treatment. Given the recent progression at age 59.780, the likelihood of survival in the next 12 months is significantly reduced.\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"
