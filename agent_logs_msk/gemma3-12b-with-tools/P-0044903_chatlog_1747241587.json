Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0044903-T01-IM6\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0044903\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Colorectal Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Rectum\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Rectal Adenocarcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT468\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 444, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 40.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"READ\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

Synergism between immunotherapy and radiotherapy may improve outcomes in LARC, even where microsatellite stable (MSS) tumours exist. The Averectal trial evaluated SCRT, followed by chemotherapy and immunotherapy with avelumab and total mesorectal excision (TME) in these patients. METHODS: Patients with LARC received SCRT (5\u202fGy x5 fractions), 6 cycles of mFOLFOX-6 plus avelumab every 2 weeks, followed by TME in an investigator-initiated, open-label, single-arm, multicentre, phase II study. The primary outcome was pCR vs. historical control. Secondary outcomes were 3-year DFS, local recurrence rate (LR) and the association of the ImmunoScore (IS) with outcomes including pCR, safety, and quality of life (QoL). RESULTS: Out Of 44 MSS patients enrolled from 3 centres (July 2018\u202f-October 2020), 40 completed treatment and analysed (65\u202f% male, median age 58.5 [31.0, 74.0] years). Median follow-up was 44 months (11.4, 51.4). Fifteen patients (37.5\u202f%) achieved pCR; and 67.5\u202f% had a major pathologic response. Mean DFS was 42 months (37.9, 46.1). Mean OS was 46.3 months (44.4, 48.2). Median DFS and OS were not reached. Three-year DFS was 85\u202f%. LRR was 2.5\u202f%. Patients with vs. without pCR had higher mean IS (68 vs. 52, p\u202f=\u202f0.036). Serious adverse events occurred in 23.5\u202f% (one was related to avelumab). Three patients died (7.5\u202f%), due to disease progression. QOL was similar between baseline and last follow-up. CONCLUSION: Adding avelumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy mFOLFOX6 after SCRT, followed by TME, improved pCR without increasing LRR, with acceptable toxicity and QOL.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Let's analyze this information in conjunction with the patient's data.\n\nThe provided article focuses on a trial using neoadjuvant therapy (short-course radiation, chemotherapy with FOLFOX, and immunotherapy with avelumab) for locally advanced rectal cancer. While the study includes patients with MSS tumors, the median age of patients in the study was 58.5, which is younger than our patient (67.3). The study also reports a 3-year DFS of 85% and a low local recurrence rate (2.5%). However, it's important to note that our patient *has already completed chemotherapy* and has shown no evidence of progression on recent imaging.\n\nGiven the patient's age, the fact that they have already completed chemotherapy, and the lack of progression on imaging, their prognosis is likely reasonably good, but not as high as the 85% DFS reported in the study (which included neoadjuvant immunotherapy). The patient's ECOG performance status of 1 suggests they are still relatively active.\n\nWhile it's impossible to provide a definitive answer, the available information suggests a reasonable likelihood of survival for the next 24 months. The patient is stable, has completed treatment, and shows no signs of active disease. However, age and the potential for other health issues always introduce uncertainty.\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"
