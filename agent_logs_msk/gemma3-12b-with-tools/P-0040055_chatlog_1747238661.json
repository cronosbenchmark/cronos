Treatment stopped around 62.79 years old.\n*   **Recent Scans (63.016 years old):** CT scan shows no evidence of progression. Performance status is ECOG 0 (good).\n*   **MSI Status:** Microsatellite Stable (MSS).\n*   **PD-L1 Status:** PD-L1 Positive.\n*   **TMB:** TMB is 5.19.\n\nConsidering this information, the patient is currently showing no evidence of progression on recent imaging, has a good performance status, and received chemotherapy. While lung adenocarcinoma can be aggressive, the current data suggests a stable disease state. The MSS status is also generally associated with a less favorable prognosis compared to MSI-High tumors, but it's not a primary driver of recurrence risk in this context.

The patient's ECOG performance status is currently 1.\n\nGiven the history of recurrence and progression, and the fact that the cancer is still present and has recently shown progression, the prognosis is concerning.
