Unlike the endogenous decapeptide GnRH, leuprolide contains a single D-amino acid (D-leucyl) residue, which helps to increase its circulating half-life from three to four minutes to approximately three hours.[A203222] As a GnRH mimic, leuprolide is capable of binding to the GnRH receptor (GnRHR) and inducing downstream modulation of both gonadotropin hormone and sex steroid levels. Prolonged activation of GnRHR results in significant downregulation of sex steroid levels, which is primarily responsible for the clinical efficacy of leuprolide in diverse conditions, including advanced prostate cancer, endometriosis, and central precocious puberty.[A203126, A203132]\r\n\r\nLeuprolide was first approved in 1985 as a daily subcutaneous injection under the tradename Lupron\u2122 by Abbvie Endocrine Inc.[L13850] Since this initial approval, various long-acting intramuscular and subcutaneous products have been developed such that patients can be dosed once every six months.[L13781, L13790] Leuprolide remains frontline therapy in all conditions for which it is indicated for use.\nDegarelix: Degarelix is used for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. Degarelix is a synthetic peptide derivative drug which binds to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors in the pituitary gland and blocks interaction with GnRH. This antagonism reduces luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) which ultimately causes testosterone suppression.

Here's what I've gathered:\n\n*   **Diagnosis:** The patient was diagnosed with Prostate Adenocarcinoma (Gleason 9) at age 51.981, Stage IV. Cancer was initially found in regional areas, extension, and nodes.\n*   **Treatment:** The patient received Degarelix and then Leuprolide, both hormone therapies.\n*   **PSA Levels:** PSA levels have decreased significantly from 9.74 ng/ml at diagnosis to 0.0 ng/ml after treatment.\n*   **Imaging:** MRIs and CT scans show the cancer initially present in lymph nodes, reproductive organs, and other areas. Later scans (52.483) showed cancer in the pelvis, abdomen, and chest. CT scans revealed no progression.\n*   **MSI Status:** Microsatellite Stable (MSS).\n\nGiven this information, the patient has undergone treatment and has shown a significant decrease in PSA levels. While initial imaging showed widespread disease, subsequent scans indicated no progression. The patient's PSA has reached 0.0 ng/ml.\n\nBased on this clinical history, it is unlikely that the cancer will recur in the next 12 months.

Prostate cancer can sometimes develop resistance to hormone therapy, and microscopic disease may still be present. However, the lack of progression on imaging and the dramatic PSA response suggest a low probability of progression in the short term.\n\nTo further refine my assessment, I could search PubMed for information on recurrence rates and progression patterns in patients with prostate adenocarcinoma who have achieved such a significant PSA response to hormone therapy.\n\n[PUBMED: prostate cancer progression hormone therapy psa 0 recurrence]"

Here's a summary of the relevant information from ages 53 to 57:\n\n*   **PSA Levels:** Initially, PSA levels showed a slight increase (0.05 to 0.36 ng/ml) after the switch to Leuprolide. However, PSA levels subsequently decreased to 0.12 ng/ml and then consistently remained at 0.0 ng/ml from age 54.576 to 56.831.\n*   **Imaging:** CT scans at 54.020 showed no progression. PET scan at 54.088 was indeterminate. MRIs at 54.568 and 56.083 showed no cancer presence.\n*   **Treatment:** The patient received Degarelix initially, then transitioned to Leuprolide.

Patients with BCR have a greater risk of disease progression and mortality. The present retrospective observational study aimed to clarify the risk factors for the BCR of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy in patients with high-risk and very high-risk prostate cancer. Patients diagnosed with prostate cancer who received radical prostatectomy in a single center from January 2009 to June 2020 were included in the study. Data from medical records were reviewed and the patients were followed up for >/=6 years. The primary outcome was BCR within 1 year after surgery. A total of 307 patients were included, with 187 in the high-risk group and 120 in the very high-risk group as classified by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. Patients in the very high-risk group had a lower BCR-free survival rate compared with those in the high-risk group, with a high risk of BCR even if their PSA levels were initially undetectable after prostatectomy, and a high risk of postoperatively detectable PSA. In patients with undetectable PSA after prostatectomy, BCR was associated with the initial PSA density, imaging stage (T3aN0M0 and T3bN0M0), and pathologic stage (any N1). Postoperatively detectable PSA was associated with pathologic stage (T3bN0M0 and any N1) In conclusion, preoperative MRI imaging stage and PSA density are predictors for short-term BCR after prostatectomy. NCCN-defined high-risk patients with a high initial PSA density, imaging stage (T3aN0M0 and T3bN0M0), and pathologic stage (any N1) had a higher risk of BCR when compared with other patients with undetectable PSA, while those with pathologic stage (T3bN0M0 or any N1) displayed a higher risk of postoperatively detectable PSA. These findings may help urologists to identify patients for whom active therapeutic protocols are necessary.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 38371200\nTitle: Low PSA radiographic disease progression on C11-choline PET.\nAuthors: Mahmoud AM, Ahmed ME, Kendi AT\nJournal: BJUI compass\nPublication Date: 2024 Mar\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: For men with prostate cancer, radiographic progression may occur without a concordant rise in prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Our study aimed to assess the prevalence of radiographic progression using C-11 choline positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in patients achieving ultra-low PSA values and to evaluate clinical outcomes in this patient population. METHODS: In a single institution study, we reviewed the prospectively maintained Mayo Clinic C-11 Choline PET metastatic prostate cancer registry to identify patients experiencing radiographic disease progression (rDP) on C-11 choline PET scan while the PSA value was less than 0.5 ng/mL. Disease progression was confirmed by tissue biopsy or response to subsequent therapy. Clinicopathologic variables were abstracted by trained research personnel. Overall survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Intergroup differences were assessed using the log-rank test. A univariate and multivariate Cox regression model was performed to investigate variables associated with poor survival after rDP. RESULTS: A total of 1323 patients within the registry experienced rDP between 2011 and 2021, including 220 (16.6%) men with rDP occurring at low PSA level. A median (interquartile range [IQR]) of 54.7 (19.7-106.9) months elapsed between the time of prostate cancer diagnosis and low PSA rDP, during which 173 patients (78%) developed castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Sites of low PSA rDP included local recurrence (n = 17, 8%), lymph node (n = 90, 41%), bone (n = 94, 43%) and visceral metastases (n = 19, 9%). Biopsy at the time of rDP demonstrated small-cell or neuroendocrine features in 21% of patients with available tissue. Over a median (IQR) follow-up of 49.4 (21.3-95.1) months from the time of low PSA rDP, 46% (n = 102) of patients died. Factors associated with poorer survival outcomes include advanced age at rDP, CRPC status, bone and visceral metastasis (p value <0.05). Visceral metastases were associated with decreased overall survival (p = 0.009 by log-rank) as compared with other sites of rDP. CONCLUSIONS: Men with prostate cancer commonly experience metastatic progression at very low or even undetectable PSA levels. Periodic imaging, even at low absolute PSA values, may result in more timely identification of disease progression.\n\n--- Article #3 ---\nPMID: 33574012\nTitle: Management of Persistently Elevated Prostate-specific Antigen After Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review of the Literature.\nAuthors: Ploussard G, Fossati N, Wiegel T\nJournal: European urology oncology\nPublication Date: 2021 Apr\nAbstract: CONTEXT: The prognosis and optimal management of pN0/pN1 patients with persistently elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 6-8 wk after radical prostatectomy (RP) remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review of oncologic outcomes and effectiveness of salvage therapies in men with a detectable PSA level after RP. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic review was performed in May 2020. A total of 2374 articles were screened, and 25 studies including 5217 men were selected and included in the systematic review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: PSA persistence was most commonly defined as PSA >0.1 ng/ml. PSA persistence was significantly correlated with disease aggressiveness and associated with worse oncologic outcomes than in men with undetectable PSA levels. The 5-yr recurrence-free survival rates varied from 21.5% to 67.0%. The >/=10-yr cancer-specific survival was 75-88%. Salvage radiotherapy +/- androgen deprivation therapy was associated with improved survival outcomes. Risk stratification according to pathologic features, PSA levels/kinetics, and genomic classifier may aid in personalization of treatment. The usefulness of molecular imaging in this setting remains underevaluated. Main limitations of this systematic review are the retrospective design of the included studies and the lack of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on this specific population. CONCLUSIONS: PSA persistence after RP is strongly correlated with poor oncologic outcomes. Our review suggests a benefit from immediate radiotherapy; however, current evidence is still low. Indication of subsequent therapies should be based on individual discussions, taking into account all the prognostic factors and the efficacy/toxicity imbalance of proposed treatment. Results from ongoing RCTs are awaited to state on the role of more intensified systemic therapy in this population. PATIENT SUMMARY: Patients with a detectable prostate-specific antigen level after surgery are at high risk of subsequent progression. Immediate radiotherapy might improve survival outcomes. Further research into the role of molecular imaging and genomic classifier is needed in this patient population.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

        "content": "Okay, I've reviewed the PubMed articles. Here's a summary of the key findings and how they inform my assessment:\n\n*   **Article 1 (Yang et al.):** Highlights the importance of preoperative MRI and PSA density in predicting biochemical recurrence, even with undetectable PSA. This suggests that imaging findings can be crucial even when PSA is low.\n*   **Article 2 (Mahmoud et al.):** This is particularly relevant. It demonstrates that radiographic progression can occur *without* a corresponding rise in PSA (low PSA radiographic disease progression). A significant proportion of patients (16.6%) experienced this, and visceral metastases were associated with poorer survival. This directly addresses the patient's current situation.\n*   **Article 3 (Ploussard et al.):** Confirms that persistently elevated PSA (though not the case here, the principles apply) is associated with worse outcomes and that salvage therapies (like radiotherapy) can improve survival.\n\nGiven the recurrence detected on MRI (chest involvement), the persistently undetectable PSA, and the findings from the PubMed articles, the prognosis is concerning. The fact that the cancer is progressing despite a PSA of 0.0 suggests a potentially aggressive variant or a disease that is not actively secreting PSA. The patient's good performance status (ECOG 1) is a positive factor, but the recurrence itself warrants serious consideration.\n\nConsidering the recurrence, the lack of PSA elevation, and the potential for visceral involvement (as highlighted by Mahmoud et al.), the likelihood of survival over the next 24 months is reduced compared to the previous assessment. While it's impossible to provide a definitive answer without further information (e.g., biopsy results, treatment plan), the evidence suggests a guarded prognosis.\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"
