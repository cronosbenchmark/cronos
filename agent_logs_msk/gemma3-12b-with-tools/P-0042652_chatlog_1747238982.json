Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nCapecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers. Capecitabine is a prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to fluorouracil (antimetabolite) in the tumor, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor tissue.\nTrametinib: Trametinib is an orally bioavailable mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2 inhibitor.[A258298,A258293] It was first approved by the FDA in May 2013 for the treatment of melanoma.[A258298] It was later approved by Health Canada on July 18, 2013 [L45588] and by the European Commission on June 30, 2014.[L45583] Trametinib is currently approved to treat a variety of cancers with BRAF mutations, such as non-small cell lung cancer and thyroid cancer, as monotherapy or in combination with [dabrafenib], a BRAF inhibitor, for improved therapeutic efficacy. Originally developed by Japan Tobacco, trametinib was initially investigated for treating inflammation, but further studies for this indication were not pursued.[A258298]\nDabrafenib: Dabrafenib mesylate (Tafinlar) is a reversible ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor and targets the MAPK pathway. It was approved on May 29, 2013, for the treatment of melanoma with V600E or V6000K mutation.[L41955] It was also used for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with the same mutation.[L41955]\r\n\r\nIn May 2018, Tafinlar (dabrafenib), in combination with Mekinist ([DB08911]), was approved to treat anaplastic thyroid cancer caused by an abnormal BRAF V600E gene.[L41955]\nNivolumab: Nivolumab is a fully human IgG4 antibody targeting the immune checkpoint programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1).[L12129] This antibody was produced entirely in mice and grafted onto human kappa and IgG4 Fc region with the mutation _S228P_ for additional stability and reduced variability.[A35203] It was developed by Bristol Myers Squibb.[L12129]\r\n\r\nNivolumab was granted FDA approval on 22 December 2014.[L12129] It is also available in combination with [relatlimab] under the brand name Opdualag.[L41265,L49996,L50001]\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0042652-T02-IM7\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0042652\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Colorectal Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Colon\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Colon Adenocarcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT505\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 548, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 30.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"COAD\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

She also received chemotherapy (Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin).\n*   **Recent Findings (around 77 years old):**\n    *   CT scans consistently show \"no progression\" of cancer.\n    *   PET scans initially showed indeterminate progression, but subsequent CT scans showed no progression.\n    *   CEA levels decreased from 7.9000 ng/ml to 1.1000 ng/ml.\n    *   MSI status is stable (MSS).\n    *   Genetic analysis indicates a Colon Adenocarcinoma with a TMB of 9.023819602.\n*   **Current Age:** 77.4 years old.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe most recent imaging (CT scans) indicate no evidence of disease progression. The decrease in CEA levels is also a positive sign, suggesting a response to treatment. The MSS status is also relevant, as MSS tumors generally have a different response to immunotherapy compared to MSI-H tumors. The patient is currently on targeted therapy (Trametinib and Dabrafenib), which are designed to specifically target cancer cells with certain mutations.\n\nGiven the lack of progression on recent imaging, the decreasing CEA levels, and the ongoing targeted therapy, the likelihood of recurrence within the next 12 months appears to be relatively low.

Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nCapecitabine: Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers. Capecitabine is a prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to fluorouracil (antimetabolite) in the tumor, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor tissue.\nTrametinib: Trametinib is an orally bioavailable mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2 inhibitor.[A258298,A258293] It was first approved by the FDA in May 2013 for the treatment of melanoma.[A258298] It was later approved by Health Canada on July 18, 2013 [L45588] and by the European Commission on June 30, 2014.[L45583] Trametinib is currently approved to treat a variety of cancers with BRAF mutations, such as non-small cell lung cancer and thyroid cancer, as monotherapy or in combination with [dabrafenib], a BRAF inhibitor, for improved therapeutic efficacy. Originally developed by Japan Tobacco, trametinib was initially investigated for treating inflammation, but further studies for this indication were not pursued.[A258298]\nDabrafenib: Dabrafenib mesylate (Tafinlar) is a reversible ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor and targets the MAPK pathway. It was approved on May 29, 2013, for the treatment of melanoma with V600E or V6000K mutation.[L41955] It was also used for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with the same mutation.[L41955]\r\n\r\nIn May 2018, Tafinlar (dabrafenib), in combination with Mekinist ([DB08911]), was approved to treat anaplastic thyroid cancer caused by an abnormal BRAF V600E gene.[L41955]\nNivolumab: Nivolumab is a fully human IgG4 antibody targeting the immune checkpoint programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1).[L12129] This antibody was produced entirely in mice and grafted onto human kappa and IgG4 Fc region with the mutation _S228P_ for additional stability and reduced variability.[A35203] It was developed by Bristol Myers Squibb.[L12129]\r\n\r\nNivolumab was granted FDA approval on 22 December 2014.[L12129] It is also available in combination with [relatlimab] under the brand name Opdualag.[L41265,L49996,L50001]\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in
