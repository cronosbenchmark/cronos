Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0039147-T01-IM6\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0039147\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Colorectal Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Ascending Colon\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Colon Adenocarcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT468\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 522, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 50.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"COAD\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.[A797]\r\n\r\nAlthough oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer.[A796,A797] This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]\r\n\r\nOxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]\nFluorouracil: A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.\nLeucovorin: Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.\nUracil: nan\nVeal: Veal allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\nDate: Date allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.\n]\n[FILE: specimen.txt] included in your context\n{\"SAMPLE_ID\": \"P-0039147-T01-IM6\", \"PATIENT_ID\": \"P-0039147\", \"CANCER_TYPE\": \"Colorectal Cancer\", \"SAMPLE_TYPE\": \"Primary\", \"SAMPLE_CLASS\": \"Tumor\", \"METASTATIC_SITE\": \"Not Applicable\", \"PRIMARY_SITE\": \"Ascending Colon\", \"CANCER_TYPE_DETAILED\": \"Colon Adenocarcinoma\", \"GENE_PANEL\": \"IMPACT468\", \"SAMPLE_COVERAGE\": 522, \"TUMOR_PURITY\": 50.0, \"ONCOTREE_CODE\": \"COAD\", \"MSI_COMMENT\": \"MICROSATELLITE STABLE (MSS).

METHODS: The clinical data of 104 cases of colorectal cancer with bone metastasis were collected and retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Among all the 104 patients included, 45 (43.3%) patients had multiple bone metastases, and 59 (56.7%) patients had single bone metastasis. Pelvis (46.1%) was the most common site, followed by thoracic vertebrae (41.3%), lumbar vertebrae (40.4%), sacral vertebrae (29.8%) and ribs (29.8%). One hundred and two patients (98.1%) were complicated with other organ metastases. The median time from colorectal cancer diagnosis to bone metastasis was 16 months, and the median time from bone metastasis to first skeletal-related events (SREs) was 1 month. The most common skeletal-related events (SREs) were the need for radiotherapy (44.2%), severe bone pain (15.4%) and pathologic fracture (9.6%). The median survival time of patients with bone metastases was 10.0 months, and 8.5 months for patients with SREs. ECOG score, systemic chemotherapy and bisphosphonate therapy were prognostic factors by univariate analysis (all P < 0.05). ECOG score and systemic chemotherapy were independent prognostic factors by Cox multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Bone metastasis in colorectal cancer patients has a poor prognosis and the use of chemotherapy and bisphosphonates may have a benefit for their survival.\n\n--- Article #2 ---\nPMID: 11748466\nTitle: Treatment and prognosis in colorectal cancer patients with bone metastasis.\nAuthors: Nozue M, Oshiro Y, Kurata M\nJournal: Oncology reports\nPublication Date: 2002 Jan-Feb\nAbstract: We have reviewed the cases of every patient presenting with bone metastasis after colorectal surgery and tried to establish the features of this clinical entity and generate basic strategies to the therapeutic management of this condition. Of 928 primary tumor resected colorectal cancer patients, 12 (1.3%) were identified with bone metastasis and included in this study. The majority of primary tumors were located at the rectosigmoid portion of the colon. All cases were highly advanced at the time of diagnosis, including 8 cases of stage IV by TNM classification. Sites of metastatic tumors were concentrated in lumber or pelvic bones. At the onset of bone metastasis, 9 of the 12 cases had other metastatic sites, i.e., only 3 patients had bone metastasis alone. Survival after onset of bone metastasis was very poor, with a median survival of approximately 5 months and a 20% survival rate at 1 year. With regard to cause of death, seven patients died of pulmonary failure, one of liver failure, and one of DIC. Only 2 cases of solitary osseous metastasis have survived more than 1 year.

METHOD: Elderly colorectal cancer patients (ECRC) from 2010 to 2015 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database were included in this study. External validation relied on Chinese patients from the China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were employed to identify liver metastasis (LM) risk variables, which were used to create a nomogram to estimate LM probabilities in patients with ECRC. Univariate and multivariable Cox analyses were performed to identify prognostic variables and further derive nomograms that could predict the OS of patients with ERCLM. Differences in lifespan were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier analysis. Finally, the quality of the nomograms was verified using decision curve analysis (DCA), calibration curves, and receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC). RESULT: In the SEER cohort, 32,330 patients were selected, of those, 3,012 (9.32%) were diagnosed with LM. A total of 188 ECRLM cases from a Chinese medical center were assigned for external validation. LM occurrence can be affected by 13 factors, including age at diagnosis, marital status, race, bone metastases, lung metastases, CEA level, tumor size, Grade, histology, primary site, T stage, N stage and sex. Furthermore, in ECRLM patients, 10 variables, including age at diagnosis, CEA level, tumor size, lung metastasis, bone metastasis, chemotherapy, surgery, N stage, grade, and race, have been shown to be independent prognostic predictors. The results from both internal and external validation revealed a high level of accuracy in predicting outcomes, as well as significant clinical utility, for the two nomograms. CONCLUSION: We created two nomograms to predict the occurrence and prognosis of LM in patients with ECRC, which would contribute significantly to the improvement in disease detection accuracy and the formulation of personalized cures for that particular demographic.\n\nNote that you can use the information from PubMed to answer the questions, but it is possible that the information is incorrect or irrelevant.

Median survival times range from 5-10 months after the onset of bone metastases.\n*   **Factors Influencing Prognosis:** As noted in the articles, factors like ECOG performance status, systemic chemotherapy, and the presence of other metastases significantly impact survival. The patient's declining performance status and the fact that the cancer has already spread to multiple sites (bone, liver) are negative prognostic indicators.\n*   **Nomogram Study:** The study on elderly colorectal cancer patients with liver metastasis highlights the importance of factors like CEA levels, tumor size, and the presence of bone metastases in predicting prognosis. This further supports the concerning outlook for this patient.\n*   **Patient-Specific Context:** The patient's age (73.9), advanced disease stage (bone and liver metastases), progression despite radiation therapy, and fluctuating but generally elevated CEA levels all contribute to a grim prognosis.\n\nGiven the totality of the evidence, and acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in predicting individual outcomes, the most responsible and evidence-based assessment is that the patient is unlikely to survive the next 6 months.\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"
