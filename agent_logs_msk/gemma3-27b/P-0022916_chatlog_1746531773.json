There is mention of potential liver and lymph node involvement at age 55.617 on MR, but this is not definitively confirmed in subsequent scans.\n*   **Treatment (Age 54.98 - 55.19):** The patient received chemotherapy with leucovorin, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin.\n*   **CEA Levels (Age 54.94 - 55.88):** CEA levels fluctuate between 1.3 and 2.5 ng/ml. These levels are generally within the normal range, although there is a slight increase at times.\n*   **ECOG Performance Status:** Fluctuates between 0 and 2, indicating varying levels of functional ability.\n*   **Recent Scans (Age 55.866):** MR scan shows no evidence of cancer.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n\nThe patient was initially diagnosed with localized disease (Stage 1-3, Clinical Group 2A). She received chemotherapy. Subsequent imaging has generally been negative for progression, although there was a brief mention of possible liver/lymph node involvement which was not confirmed. CEA levels have remained relatively stable and within normal limits. MSS status and a TMB of 6.9 are not strongly predictive of recurrence.\n\nGiven the localized initial stage, the negative scans, and stable CEA levels, the risk of recurrence within the next 9 months appears to be relatively low. However, it's important to note that recurrence can still occur, even with these favorable factors.\n\n[ANSWER: B]"

While the recent CT scans show no *further* progression after starting chemotherapy, the CEA levels remain elevated (around 2.0-2.2 ng/ml), and the initial rise to 10.1 ng/ml is concerning. The fact that the scans don't show a clear response to treatment suggests the chemotherapy may not be fully effective. Given the liver metastasis, the recurrence after initial treatment, and the lack of a strong response to subsequent chemotherapy, the prognosis is poor.\n\nConsidering the aggressive nature of the recurrence and the limited response to treatment, it is unlikely the patient will be alive in the next 12 months.\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"
