Here's what I've gathered:\n\n*   **Diagnosis:** Lung adenocarcinoma (specifically Adenocarcinoma Combined With Other Types Of Carcinoma) at age 55.142.\n*   **Stage:** AJCC Stage IIA, Clinical Group 1A, Pathological Group 2A. This indicates a regional disease, involving lymph nodes.\n*   **Genetic Testing:** IMPACT410 panel was performed on a primary tumor sample. MSI status is stable. TMB is 2.936.\n*   **Treatment:** The patient received chemotherapy with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin between ages 55.427 and 55.5995.\n*   **Follow-up:** Multiple CT scans (55.282, 55.569, 56.082) and a PET scan (55.410) have been performed. All scans indicate *no progression* of the cancer.\n*   **Recent Scan:** The most recent scan at age 56.082 shows no evidence of cancer progression.\n\nBased on this information, the patient has Stage IIA lung adenocarcinoma, has completed chemotherapy, and has shown no evidence of disease progression on multiple follow-up scans over the past year. Stage IIA lung cancer has a relatively good prognosis, and the lack of progression is a positive sign.\n\nHowever, recurrence is *always* a possibility, even with negative scans. The risk depends on many factors, including the completeness of the initial surgery, the specific genetic characteristics of the tumor, and the patient's overall health.\n\nGiven the available data, and the consistent \"no progression\" findings, the probability of recurrence in the next 12 months is relatively low, but not zero. It's difficult to give a definitive \"yes\" or \"no\" without more detailed information.\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"

Initially, scans showed no progression.\n*   **Recurrence (around 56.6 years):** The cancer recurred, initially detected in lymph nodes via PET scan.\n*   **Subsequent Scans & Treatment (56.6 - 59.8 years):** Multiple CT and MR scans show fluctuating results \u2013 periods of \"no progression\" interspersed with periods of progression. The patient received a second course of chemotherapy (Cisplatin and Pemetrexed) between ages 58.364 and 58.5365.\n*   **Most Recent Scan (59.780 years):** The most recent CT scan shows *progression* of the cancer.\n*   **Genetic Profile (Specimen.txt):** The genetic profile from the initial tumor sample (IMPACT410) shows a TMB of 2.936 and MSI stable status.
