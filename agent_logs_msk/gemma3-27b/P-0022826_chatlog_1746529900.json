While pancreatic cancer has a high risk of recurrence, the lack of progression on serial imaging is a positive sign. The ECOG performance status of 1 also suggests the patient is relatively well. However, the relatively short follow-up period (approximately 6 months from diagnosis to the latest data point) limits the ability to confidently predict long-term recurrence risk.\n\nWithout further information on adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy/radiation post-surgery) and more extended follow-up imaging, it's difficult to give a definitive answer. However, based on the available data, the risk of recurrence in the *next 6 months* appears relatively low.\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"
