However, it is important to remember that Stage IV cancer has a high risk of recurrence. The fact that the cancer is MSS suggests it may be less responsive to immunotherapy.\n\nWhile the current data is encouraging, predicting recurrence with certainty is impossible.

Initially, at 70.686, scans showed no progression. However, by 70.933, progression was evident, initially in the lungs. Later, progression was also seen in the liver.\n*   **CEA Levels:** CEA levels have risen dramatically, from 1.8 ng/ml at age 70.686 to 329.5 ng/ml at age 72.448. This is a strong indicator of increasing tumor burden.\n*   **Multiple Sites:** The cancer has spread to both the lungs and the liver.\n*   **Rapid Progression:** The rate of progression appears to be accelerating, especially in the last few months of the timeline.\n\nConsidering this information, the patient's prognosis is now significantly worse than it was at 70.5 years old.
