Subsequently, they received Gemcitabine from age 63.859.\n*   **Response to Treatment:** Multiple CT scans (ages 63.303, 63.523, 63.638, 63.722, and 63.829) consistently show **no progression** of the cancer. In fact, at ages 63.722 and 63.829, the CT scans indicate the cancer is *not present* in certain areas (abdomen and chest).\n*   **Tumor Markers:** CA 19-9 levels have decreased significantly from 655 at age 63.303 to 14 at age 63.783. CEA levels have also decreased from 6.8 to 1.8.\n*   **Performance Status:** Initially ECOG 1, improved to ECOG 0 at age 63.610, then back to ECOG 1 at age 63.783, and back to ECOG 0 at age 63.840.\n*   **MSI Status:** MSI Stable.\n*   **TMB:** 0.978719698\n\nGiven this information, particularly the consistent reports of no progression on CT scans and the decreasing tumor marker levels, the cancer is currently well-controlled with treatment. While pancreatic cancer is aggressive, the patient is responding favorably to therapy.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that this is a snapshot in time. Pancreatic cancer can recur or progress even after initial good response. Predicting the next 6 months with absolute certainty is impossible.\n\nConsidering the current evidence, I believe the probability of progression in the next 6 months is relatively low, assuming continued treatment and monitoring.\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"

The disease is now present in the liver, bone, and potentially other sites.\n*   **Current Age (66.6):** The patient is currently receiving treatment, but the recent scans indicate disease progression despite therapy.\n\nGiven this information, particularly the recent progression to bone metastases and the rising tumor markers, the prognosis is unfortunately poor. While it's impossible to predict with certainty, the likelihood of survival for another 12 months is significantly reduced. The cancer is now metastatic and progressing despite treatment.\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"
