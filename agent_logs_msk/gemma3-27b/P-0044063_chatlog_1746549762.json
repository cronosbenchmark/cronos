Specifically, I require the following:\n\n1.  **Detailed genomic profiling results:** The specific mutations and copy number alterations identified are crucial. Some mutations are associated with higher recurrence rates.\n2.  **Staging information:** The stage of the colon adenocarcinoma at diagnosis is a primary factor in recurrence risk.\n3.  **Treatment details:** What treatments has the patient received (surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, targeted therapy, immunotherapy)? The type and effectiveness of treatment significantly impact recurrence risk.\n4.  **Laboratory evaluation trends:** Trends in CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) and other tumor markers can indicate recurrence.\n5.  **Pathology report:** Details from the original pathology report, including grade, lymph node involvement, and other histopathological features.\n\nTherefore, I request the following files:\n\n[REQUEST: pathology_report.txt]\n[REQUEST: genomic_profile.txt]\n[REQUEST: treatment_history.txt]\n[REQUEST: lab_results.txt]\n\n\n\n"

Colon adenocarcinoma recurrence rates vary significantly based on stage.
