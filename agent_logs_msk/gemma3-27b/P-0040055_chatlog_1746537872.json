ECOG performance status is 0.\n\nGiven this information, the patient has early-stage lung adenocarcinoma that was initially regional to lymph nodes. She received chemotherapy and, as of age 63.016, a CT scan showed no evidence of progression. The PD-L1 positivity suggests potential benefit from immunotherapy, although it's not stated whether she received it. MSS status suggests immunotherapy may be less effective than in MSI-high tumors, but still potentially beneficial.\n\nPredicting recurrence with absolute certainty is impossible. However, the lack of progression on the recent scan is a positive sign. Early-stage disease with complete resection and adjuvant chemotherapy has a relatively good prognosis.\n\nConsidering the available data, I would lean towards a lower risk of recurrence within the next 12 months, but ongoing surveillance is crucial.\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"
