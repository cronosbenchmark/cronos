However, subsequent CT scans at ages 68.707 and 69.310 showed no progression. An MR scan at age 68.186 showed indeterminate progression.\n*   **Performance Status:** ECOG 0 at age 68.189 (excellent performance status)\n*   **Current Age:** 69.5 years old\n\nBased on this limited information, the patient initially showed progression after diagnosis, but subsequent imaging suggests stability. The ECOG performance status is excellent. However, the initial progression is concerning. The stage (1-3) is broad and doesn't give a precise indication of risk.\n\nGiven the initial progression followed by stability, and the lack of detailed information about the extent of the initial progression and response to chemotherapy, it's difficult to definitively predict recurrence. However, the fact that recent scans (up to age 69.310) show no progression is a positive sign.\n\nConsidering the available data, I would lean towards a lower risk of recurrence in the next 12 months, but it is not zero.\n\n[ANSWER: B]"
