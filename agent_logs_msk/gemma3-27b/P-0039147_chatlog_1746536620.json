MSS (Microsatellite Stable). TMB (Tumor Mutational Burden) is 9.51.\n*   **Initial Treatment:** Surgery at 71.227 years old.\n*   **CEA Levels:** Initially 3.5 ng/ml, fluctuating between 1.8 and 4.3 ng/ml, then rising to 14.0 ng/ml at 72.035 years old. Recent CEA levels are around 6.1-8.7 ng/ml.\n*   **Disease Progression:** Initial CT scan at 71.142 showed no progression. However, a CT scan at 72.035 *did* show progression, with metastasis to the liver. Subsequent scans (72.202, 72.600) showed no progression, and a PET scan (72.621) was indeterminate. An MR scan (72.668) showed no progression.\n*   **Chemotherapy:** Received chemotherapy (Leucovorin, Fluorouracil, and Oxaliplatin) between ages 72.202 and 72.5475.\n*   **Performance Status:** ECOG performance status has fluctuated between 0 and 2, currently at 1.\n\nGiven this information, the patient *has* experienced disease progression with liver metastasis. While recent scans suggest stability, the rising CEA levels and prior progression are concerning. The patient is currently 72.7 years old.\n\nConsidering the history of progression, the current CEA levels, and the fact that the patient has already undergone treatment, the risk of recurrence within the next 6 months is significant.\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"

I've already reviewed `specimen.txt` and `timeline0.txt`, which provide a good foundation.\n\nHere's what I know:\n\n*   **History of Metastasis:** The patient had liver metastasis detected at 72.035 years old.\n*   **Chemotherapy Response:** The patient received chemotherapy between 72.202 and 72.5475 years old. While the timeline indicates no progression on scans at 72.600 and 72.668, the CEA levels remain elevated (6.1-8.7 ng/ml) and were previously much higher (14.0 ng/ml). This suggests the chemotherapy may have controlled the disease but not eradicated it.\n*   **Current Status:** ECOG performance status is currently 1, indicating some functional impairment.\n*   **MSS/TMB:** The tumor is MSS with a TMB of 9.51. This suggests a lower likelihood of response to immunotherapy.\n\nGiven the history of metastasis, the persistent elevation of CEA levels despite recent stable scans, and the patient's age and performance status, the probability of progression within the next 6 months is relatively high. While the recent scans are reassuring, CEA is a sensitive marker and its continued elevation is a red flag.\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"

While not dramatically high, the trend is concerning given the documented progression.\n*   **ECOG Performance Status:** The ECOG performance status has fluctuated between 0 and 1, indicating some functional decline.\n*   **Recent Scans (73.660-73.665):** Recent CT and PET scans show no evidence of *further* progression at these timepoints, but the prior progression is significant.\n*   **Radiation Therapy:** Received radiation therapy at 73.136.\n\nGiven the documented progression on multiple scans within the last six months, the presence of bone metastases, and the fluctuating CEA levels, the likelihood of further progression in the next six months is very high. The recent scans showing stability are a small positive, but the overall trend is concerning.
