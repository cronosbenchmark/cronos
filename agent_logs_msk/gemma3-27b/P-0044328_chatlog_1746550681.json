The cancer was initially regional to lymph nodes.\n*   **Molecular Profile:** The tumor is PD-L1 positive, MSI stable, and has a TMB of 14.7.\n*   **Treatment:** The patient received chemotherapy with Paclitaxel and Carboplatin around age 50.\n*   **Follow-up:** Multiple CT scans (at ages 49.76, 50.32, 50.83, 51.32, and 51.84) have consistently shown *no progression* of the cancer.\n*   **Current Age:** The patient is now 52 years old.\n\nGiven the consistent reports of no progression on CT scans over approximately 2 years, the risk of recurrence in the next 12 months appears low.
