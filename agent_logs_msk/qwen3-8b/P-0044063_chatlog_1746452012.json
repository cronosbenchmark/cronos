She was treated with chemotherapy involving oxaliplatin and capecitabine. \n\n2. **Response to Therapy**: The cancer did not progress during the CT scans conducted at various time points (44.617, 44.831, and 45.445 years). Her CEA levels remained stable (0.8-0.9 ng/mL), indicating a favorable response to treatment.\n\n3. **Performance Status**: Her ECOG performance status was generally good (0), with some fluctuations, suggesting she was able to tolerate treatment and maintain a reasonable quality of life.\n\n4. **Follow-Up**: The most recent CT scan (at 45.445 years) showed no progression of the cancer. This supports the conclusion that the cancer is currently under control.\n\nGiven these findings, the likelihood of recurrence within the next 12 months is **low**, as the cancer has not progressed and the treatment has been effective so far.\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"
