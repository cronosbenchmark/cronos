Recent PSA levels have been decreasing: from 9.74 ng/ml at baseline to 0.89 ng/ml and then to 0.53 ng/ml, and finally to 0.0 ng/ml. This suggests a favorable response to treatment, with no evidence of progression on imaging (CT and MR scans).\n\n3. **Tumor Stability**: There is no indication of tumor progression on imaging studies performed at 52.483 years and 52.598 years. The cancer has not progressed based on the latest scans.\n\n4. **Clinical Summary**: The patient's ECOG performance status is 0, indicating good functional status. Additionally, the absence of metastatic sites in recent imaging is notable.\n\nConsidering the above data, there is currently no evidence of cancer recurrence or progression. The tumor appears to be under control, and the PSA levels are at their lowest recorded point.\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"
