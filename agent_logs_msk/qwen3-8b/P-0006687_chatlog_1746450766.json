However, the most recent data at age 59.068 shows that the cancer has not progressed, and the CEA levels are stable. The patient's clinical status at age 59.1 years shows no evidence of progression, and the cancer remains stable. Given this information, the likelihood of the patient being alive in the next 12 months is high.\n\n[ANSWER: A) Yes]"
