The patient received multiple treatments, including chemotherapy with agents such as oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan. Radiation therapy was also administered.\n\nThroughout the timeline, the patient underwent multiple CT scans, and the cancer was noted to have NOT progressed in all instances. Additionally, the CA 19-9 levels, which are often used as a tumor marker for pancreatic cancer, showed a significant decrease over time, from 1043 units/ml at diagnosis to 56 units/ml at age 61.687 years. This decrease suggests a positive response to treatment.\n\nGiven that the cancer has not progressed and the tumor markers have significantly decreased, it is likely that the cancer will not recur within the next 24 months. However, it is important to note that cancer recurrence can occur even if the tumor markers are decreasing and the cancer appears to be responding well to treatment. Therefore, the patient should continue to be monitored closely for any signs of recurrence.\n\n[ANSWER: B) No]"
