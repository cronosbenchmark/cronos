The patient's performance status has fluctuated, with ECOG scores ranging from 0 to 2.\n\nThe timeline data shows that the patient's cancer has not progressed in the last 12 months, with multiple CT scans revealing no progression. The patient's CEA levels have been monitored, with values ranging from 1.3 to 2.4 ng/ml.\n\nGiven this information, I believe that the patient's prognosis is relatively favorable, and it is likely that the patient will survive for the next 12 months. The patient's stable disease status, relatively low CEA levels, and stable performance status all suggest a positive outlook.\n\n[ANSWER: A]"
