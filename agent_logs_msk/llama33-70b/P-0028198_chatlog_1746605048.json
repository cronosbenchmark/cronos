The tumor sample was sequenced, and the mutation data is available. The patient's clinical history shows that she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer at the age of 73.504 and underwent various treatments, including chemotherapy.\n\nThe laboratory test results show that the patient's CA 19-9 levels decreased from 99 to 39 units/ml over time, and her CEA levels fluctuated between 1.3 and 2.5 ng/ml. The patient's ECOG performance status improved from 1 to 0, indicating a better overall health condition.\n\nHowever, the CT scan results at age 74.379 showed that the cancer had progressed, which is a concerning sign. Nevertheless, the subsequent CT scan at age 74.625 revealed that the cancer had not progressed further.\n\nGiven this information, it is challenging to predict with certainty whether the cancer will recur in the next 12 months. However, considering the patient's improved performance status, decreased CA 19-9 levels, and stable CEA levels, I would lean towards a more optimistic prognosis.\n\n[ANSWER: B]"
