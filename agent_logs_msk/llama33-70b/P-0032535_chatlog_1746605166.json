The CEA levels have also been increasing, which could be a sign of cancer progression.\n\nGiven this information, it seems unlikely that the patient will still be alive in the next 12 months. The patient's cancer has progressed, and the treatment has not been effective in stopping the progression. The increasing CA 19-9 and CEA levels, along with the decline in the patient's ECOG performance status, suggest a poor prognosis.\n\n[ANSWER: B]"
