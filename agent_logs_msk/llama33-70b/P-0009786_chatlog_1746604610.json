The patient has undergone hormone therapy with Degarelix and Leuprolide, and radiation therapy. The cancer has recurred, but the patient's performance status, as measured by the ECOG score, is 0, indicating that the patient is able to carry out daily activities with no effort, and then it changed to 1, indicating that the patient is able to carry out daily activities with some effort, but may need to rest occasionally.\n\nThe patient's Gleason score is 9, which indicates a high-grade tumor. The patient's cancer type is prostate adenocarcinoma, and the tumor purity is 50.0%. The patient's MSI score is 0.16, which indicates microsatellite stability.\n\nGiven the patient's current age of 58, the low PSA levels, and the patient's response to treatment, I believe that the patient is likely to survive for at least the next 24 months. However, the patient's cancer recurrence and high Gleason score indicate a higher risk of mortality.\n\n[ANSWER: A]"
