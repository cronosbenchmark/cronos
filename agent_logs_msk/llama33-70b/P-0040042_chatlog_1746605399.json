The patient's cancer has progressed, and the most recent CT scan reveals cancer progression.\n\nThe patient's CEA levels have been fluctuating, with the most recent level being 4.3000 ng/ml at age 64.972. The patient's ECOG score has been fluctuating between 0 and 2, indicating some symptoms but still able to carry out daily activities.\n\nThe patient's tumor sites have been identified as lymph nodes, lung, pleura, liver, and other sites. The cancer has metastasized to other sites, and the patient has undergone multiple treatments.\n\nGiven this information, it appears that the patient's cancer is progressing, and the patient's overall health is declining. The increasing CEA levels and cancer progression suggest a poor prognosis.\n\nHowever, the patient's ECOG score is still relatively low, indicating that the patient is still able to carry out daily activities. The patient's recent lab tests show a decrease in CEA levels, which could be a positive sign.\n\nConsidering the patient's age, cancer progression, and overall health, I would estimate that the likelihood of the patient's survival in the next 12 months is relatively low.\n\n[ANSWER: B]"
