The tumor mutational burden (TMB) is 0.864698095, which is relatively low.\n\nThe timeline0.txt file provides a detailed history of the patient's diagnosis, treatments, and lab tests. The patient was diagnosed with lung cancer at age 65.322 and underwent various tests, including CT scans, PET scans, and MR scans, to monitor the progression of the disease. The patient also underwent surgery and received chemotherapy treatment with paclitaxel and carboplatin.\n\nNotably, the timeline0.txt file shows that the patient's cancer presence was detected as \"No\" at age 66.018 and 66.596, indicating that the patient may have achieved a complete response to treatment. However, the file also shows that the patient's cancer presence was detected as \"Yes\" at other time points, including age 66.043 and 66.339, suggesting that the disease may still be active.\n\nGiven this information, it is difficult to predict with certainty whether the patient's cancer will recur in the next 6 months.
